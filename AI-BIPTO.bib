  abstract = {In the past three decades, local search has grown from a simple heuristic idea into a mature field of research in combinatorial optimization that is attracting ever-increasing attention. Local search is still the method of choice for NP-hard problems as it provides a robust approach for obtaining high-quality solutions to problems of a realistic size in reasonable time. Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization covers local search and its variants from both a theoretical and practical point of view, each topic discussed by a leading authority. This book is an important reference and invaluable source of inspiration for students and researchers in discrete mathematics, computer science, operations research, industrial engineering, and management science.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable, yet effective, metaheuristic called FILO to solve large-scale instances of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. Our approach consists of a main iterative part, based on the Iterated Local Search paradigm, which employs a carefully designed combination of existing acceleration techniques, as well as novel strategies to keep the optimization localized, controlled, and tailored to the current instance and solution. A Simulated Annealing-based neighbor acceptance criterion is used to obtain a continuous diversification, to ensure the exploration of different regions of the search space. Results on extensively studied benchmark instances from the literature, supported by a thorough analysis of the algorithm's main components, show the effectiveness of the proposed design choices, making FILO highly competitive with existing state-of-the-art algorithms, both in terms of computing time and solution quality. Finally, guidelines for possible efficient implementations, algorithm source code, and a library of reusable components are open-sourced to allow reproduction of our results and promote further investigations.},

  abstract = {This thesis deals with the efficient resolution of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs).  The first chapter faces the archetype of all VRPs: the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Despite having being introduced more than 60 years ago, it still remains an extremely challenging problem. In this chapter I design a Fast Iterated-Local-Search Localized Optimization algorithm for the CVRP, shortened to FILO. The simplicity of the CVRP definition allowed me to experiment with advanced local search acceleration and pruning techniques that have eventually became the core optimization engine of FILO. FILO experimentally shown to be extremely scalable and able to solve very large scale instances of the CVRP in a fraction of the computing time compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, still obtaining competitive solutions in terms of their quality. The second chapter deals with an extension of the CVRP called the Extended Single Truck and Trailer Vehicle Routing Problem, or simply XSTTRP. The XSTTRP models a broad class of VRPs in which a single vehicle, composed of a truck and a detachable trailer, has to serve a set of customers with accessibility constraints making some of them not reachable by using the entire vehicle. This problem moves towards VRPs including more realistic constraints and it models scenarios such as parcel deliveries in crowded city centers or rural areas, where maneuvering a large vehicle is forbidden or dangerous. The XSTTRP generalizes several well known VRPs such as the Multiple Depot VRP and the Location Routing Problem. For its solution I developed an hybrid metaheuristic which combines a fast heuristic optimization with a polishing phase based on the resolution of a limited set partitioning problem. Finally, the thesis includes a final chapter aimed at guiding the computational evaluation of new approaches to VRPs proposed by the machine learning community.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with sequence and machine dependent setup times and machine eligibility constraints. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). Instances of more than 500 jobs and 50 machines are not uncommon in industry. Such large instances become increasingly challenging to provide high-quality solutions within limited amount of computational time, but so far, have not been adequately addressed in recent literature. A hybrid genetic algorithm is developed, which is lean in the sense that is equipped with a minimal number of parameters and operators, and which is enhanced with an effective local search operator, specifically targeted to solve large instances. For evaluation purposes a new set of larger problems is generated, consisting of up to 800 jobs and 60 machines. An extensive comparative study shows that the proposed method performs significantly better compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially for the new larger instances. Also, it is demonstrated that calibration is crucial and in practice it should be targeted at a narrower set of representative instances.},

  abstract = {We propose an improvement-heuristic approach for the general flow-shop problem (n/m/Cmax) based on the idea of adaptive learning. The approach employs a one-pass heuristic to give a good starting solution in the search space and uses a weight parameter to perturb the data of the original problem to obtain improved solutions. The weights are then adjusted employing a learning strategy which involves reinforcement and backtracking. The learning is similar to that in neural networks. The random perturbation allows a non-deterministic local search. We apply the improvement-heuristic approach in conjunction with three well-known heuristics in the literature, namely, Palmer's Slope Index, CDS and NEH. We test our approach on several benchmark problem sets including Taillard's, Carlier's, Heller's and Reeves'. We compare our results to the best-known upper-bound solutions and find that for many problems we match the best-known upper bound. For one problem we discover a new upper bound.},

It is a high-level local search that generates tailored genetic algorithms for considered problem instances. The motivation of this work is to reduce the time needed to design a dedicated genetic algorithm for a new instance increasing the chance to explore undiscovered search spaces. It uses three search spaces to build genetic algorithms. In the first one, standard blind operators are used. In the second one, problem-oriented ones are used and finally, in the last one, knowledge extracted during the search process is taken into consideration through diversification and intensification strategies. HHABS's solving process explores the three search spaces starting from the standard one and jumps to the next search spaces until it gets the best found solution so far, for the given instance, or all search spaces are covered. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the well-known PFSP. The performance comparison, on the Taillard instances, against state-of-the-art algorithms verified the reliability of the proposed organization of the search space on its performance. Besides, it allowed us to classify instances into easy, medium and difficult.},

Since the appearance of that survey paper, there has been an increasing interest in scheduling problems with setup times (costs) with an average of more than 40 papers per year being added to the literature. The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the scheduling literature on models with setup times (costs) from then to date covering more than 300 papers. Given that so many papers have appeared in a short time, there are cases where different researchers addressed the same problem independently, and sometimes by using even the same technique, e.g., genetic algorithm. Throughout the paper we identify such areas where independently developed techniques need to be compared. The paper classifies scheduling problems into those with batching and non-batching considerations, and with sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup times. It further categorizes the literature according to shop environments, including single-machine, parallel machines, flow shop, no-wait flow shop, flexible flow shop, job shop, open shop, and others.},

In this paper we aim to demonstrate that a well-implemented local search on its own suffices to create a heuristic that computes high-quality solutions in a short time. To this end we combine three powerful local search techniques, and implement them in an efficient way that minimizes computational effort. We conduct a series of experiments to determine how local search can be effectively combined with perturbation and pruning, and make use of problem-specific knowledge, to guide the search to promising solutions more effectively. The heuristic created in this way not only performs well on many benchmark sets, it is also straightforward in its design and does not contain any components of which the contribution is unclear.},

Even though a large amount of research focuses on tuning heuristics on a specific problem, little research has been done to investigate structural characteristics of the problem itself. We argue that knowledge about the structural characteristics that distinguish good from not-so-good solutions of a combinatorial optimization problem, can be instrumental in designing efficient heuristics. We develop a data-mining based approach that can generate such knowledge and apply it to the vehicle routing problem. We define several metrics to characterize both a VRP solution and a VRP instance, and generate and classify 192.000 solutions for various instances. With these metrics we are able to distinguish between optimal and non-optimal solutions with an accuracy of up to 90\%. We discuss the most distinguishing characteristics of good VRP solutions, and show how the knowledge thus generated can be used to improve the performance of an existing heuristic.},

During the local search, each pattern is used to define one move in which 1)~incompatible edges are disconnected, 2)~the edges defined by the pattern are reconnected, and 3)~the remaining solution fragments are optimally reconnected. Each such move is accepted only in case of solution improvement. As visible in our experiments, this strategy results in a new paradigm of local search, which complements and enhances classical search approaches in a controllable amount of computational time. We demonstrate that PILS identifies useful high-order moves that would otherwise not be found by enumeration, and that it significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art population-based and neighborhood-centered metaheuristics.},

In the dynamic case, multiple possible scenarios for the occurrence of future requests are considered to decide about the opportunity to include a new request into the current solution. It is worth noting that the real-time decision is about the acceptance of the new request, not about its service which can only take place in some future routes (a delivery route being closed as soon as a vehicle departs from the depot). In the computational results, a comparison is provided with a myopic approach which does not consider scenarios of future requests.},

We show that it is possible to solve this complex variant with an exact branch-and-price approach and some derived heuristics. On one side, this problem could be modeled as a set partitioning type problem with low to moderate density (the number of ones per column, i.e., clients to visit, is not large). Such problems have some nice polyhedral properties to consider for favoring integrality. In the other side, some complex handling rules apply due to the problem's context. A natural way is to address them in the column generation subproblem as an elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints, which constitutes the major bottleneck. To succeed in this challenge, we need to design some sophisticated techniques i) for branching to profit from the polyhedral properties and ii) for solving the column generation subproblem. Direct use of on-the-shelf algorithms does not work, unfortunately. Numerical results on a real network (four depots, five types of petroleum products, four main groups of clients, heterogeneous fleet of highly compartmented tank trucks) prove the effectiveness and high potential of the proposed approach.},

It is because of these capabilities that Constraint Programming is increasingly being employed as a problem-solving tool to solve scheduling problems. Hence the development of Constraint-Based Scheduling as a field of study.  The aim of this book is to provide an overview of the most widely used Constraint-Based Scheduling techniques. Following the principles of Constraint Programming, the book consists of three distinct parts:   The first chapter introduces the basic principles of Constraint Programming and provides a model of the constraints that are the most often encountered in scheduling problems.   Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 are focused on the propagation of resource constraints, which usually are responsible for the "hardness" of the scheduling problem.   Chapters 6, 7, and 8 are dedicated to the resolution of several scheduling problems. These examples illustrate the use and the practical efficiency of the constraint propagation methods of the previous chapters. They also show that besides constraint propagation, the exploration of the search space must be carefully designed, taking into account specific properties of the considered problem (e.g., dominance relations, symmetries, possible use of decomposition rules).   Chapter 9 mentions various extensions of the model and presents promising research directions.},

The fleet is homogeneous and is located at a common depot. Each node requires the same type of service. An exact method is introduced based on branch and cut. In the computations, ever increasing lower bounds on the optimal solution are obtained by solving a series of relaxed problems that incorporate newly found valid inequalities. Feasible solutions or upper bounds are obtained with the help of greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). A wide variety of cuts is introduced to tighten the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the original mixed-integer program. To find violated cuts, it is necessary to solve a separation problem. A substantial portion of the paper is aimed at describing the heuristics developed for this purpose. A new approach for obtaining feasible solutions from the LP relaxation is also discussed. Numerical results for standard 50- and 100-node benchmark problems are reported.},

Over the last decades, many variants of LS using different neighborhood operators, exploration strategies, and speedup techniques have been developed. These design choices can critically influence the performance of an LS in terms of both solution quality and computational effort. Despite the importance of LS in metaheuristics for VRPs, systematic investigations on the impact and importance of different design decisions in LS are nonexistent even for basic VRP variants, and clear recommendations on meaningful combinations of these decisions are not available. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of design decisions in a granular LS for the capacitated VRP (CVRP). To this end, we compare the performance of a large number of algorithmic variants of the granular LS on two CVRP benchmark sets. We use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine non-dominated algorithmic variants, and we use performance profiles to visualize the results with regard to solution quality and runtime. In this way, we are able to identify good combinations of decisions and give final design recommendations on granular LS. Several of these recommendations disagree with popular choices in the literature and are therefore valuable for researchers and practitioners working on VRPs.},

The latter takes the form of a dispatching list that defines, for each zone of the covered territory, an ordered list providing a hierarchy of ambulances to be chosen whenever a call arrives. While decisions concerning the ambulance locations are of a tactical nature and often based on static information (i.e. average demand), ambulance dispatching is a real-time decision that must take into consideration the current state of the system (i.e. busy and idle ambulances) when selecting the ambulance to respond to the incoming emergency call. Although only few works have considered these two decisions jointly, they all conclude that the system's performance can be improved and the fleet management decisions streamlined by doing so. However, one of the challenges of the ALDP lies in the estimation of the ambulance availability, which has been addressed in previous papers by means of queueing approaches. In this paper, we propose a recursive simulation-optimization framework which encompasses a mathematical formulation for the ALDP and a discrete event simulation model that produces both empirical estimations of the ambulance availability and the system's performance. Extensive numerical experiments on a set of realistic instances show the potential of the proposed approach as an effective tool for dealing with EMS decision-making.},

Instead of trying to improve the typical metaheuristics used to efficiently solve vehicle routing problems, like large neighborhood search, iterated local search, or evolutionary algorithms, we allow them to explore the deeply infeasible regions of the search space in a controlled way. The key idea is to find solutions better in terms of the objective function even at the cost of violation of constraints, and then try to restore feasibility of the obtained solutions at a minimum cost. Furthermore, in order to preserve the best feasible solutions, we maintain two diversified pools of solutions, the main pool and the temporary working pool. The main pool stores the best diversified (almost) feasible solutions, while the working pool is used to generate new solutions and is periodically refilled with disturbed solutions from the main pool. We demonstrate our method on the vehicle routing problems, with variants respecting time, vehicle capacity and fleet limitation constraints. Our method provided a large number of new best-known solutions on well-known benchmark datasets. Although our method is designed for the family of vehicle routing problems, its concept is fairly general and it could potentially be applied to other NP-hard problems with constraints.},

  abstract = {The best performing approximate methods proposed for the permutational flow shop scheduling problem with makespan minimization are the well known NEH constructive heuristic and the iterated greedy algorithm. Both methods are based on the successive insertion (or reinsertion) of jobs into a partial schedule, evaluating the makespan of the resulting schedule for all insertion positions, and selecting the insertion position that presents the shortest makespan. Frequently, there are many tied insertion positions that produce such shortest makespan. Thus, a tiebreaker must be used to discern a selection among the tied insertion positions. Many tiebreakers have been proposed in the literature for this case. These tiebreakers improve the results produced by approximate methods when embedded into them. In this paper we propose two new tiebreakers that use a weighted and an unweighted approximation of the idle time increment produced by inserting the job into each tied insertion position. They were designed considering the reversibility property of the PFSSP. Our computational experiments show that the proposed tiebreakers outperform tiebreakers from the literature when evaluated within the NEH heuristic and within the iterated greedy algorithm. The iterated greedy algorithms with the proposed tiebreakers embedded are the best approximate methods so far for the permutational flow shop scheduling problem.},

As a result, jMetalPy provides an environment for solving multi-objective optimization problems focused not only on traditional metaheuristics, but also on techniques supporting preference articulation, constrained and dynamic problems, along with a rich set of features related to the automatic generation of statistical data from the results generated, as well as the real-time and interactive visualization of the Pareto front approximations produced by the algorithms. jMetalPy offers additionally support for parallel computing in multicore and cluster systems. We include some use cases to explore the main features of jMetalPy and to illustrate how to work with it.},

It presents a multiple scenario approach (MSA) that continuously generates routing plans for scenarios including known and future requests. Decisions during execution use a distinguished plan chosen, at each decision, by a consensus function. The approach was evaluated on vehicle routing problems adapted from the Solomon benchmarks with a degree of dynamism varying between 30\% and 80\%. They indicate that MSA exhibits dramatic improvements over approaches not exploiting stochastic information, that the use of consensus function improves the quality of the solutions significantly, and that the benefits of MSA increase with the (effective) degree of dynamism.},

Experimental results show that waiting and relocation strategies may dramatically improve customer service, especially for problems that are highly dynamic and contain many late requests. The decisions to wait and to relocate do not exploit any problem-specific features but rather are obtained by including choices in the online algorithm that are necessarily sub-optimal in an offline setting.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) represent undesirable complications that occur during a hospital stay. HACs can compromise patient safety and care outcomes and result in unnecessary socio-economic costs. Although hospitals are expected to reduce the incidence of HACs, few studies have examined the implications of HACs on other clinical outcomes and measures of hospital performance. This study contributes to the literature by exploring the relationship between exposure to a set of target HACs, length of stay (LOS) performance, and 30-day readmission risk. Methodology/results: To estimate the effects of HACs, we conduct econometric analyses using patient-visit-level data for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia patients hospitalized in the U.S. state of Florida during 2010\textendash 2014. We define LOS performance as the deviation of LOS from the Geometric Mean LOS (GMLOS), a standard LOS set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. First, we find that exposure to HACs leads to a 37\% increase in the odds of readmission and a 79\% increase in LOS. Second, an increase in LOS is associated with a decrease in readmission risk, and this decrease is stronger for patients exposed to HACs. Third, LOS performance mediates the HACs-readmission risk relationship, such that the increase in the readmission risk of a HAC patient can be fully suppressed by the patient's LOS. Fourth, we find that for patients exposed to HACs, the benefits of a longer LOS are almost entirely capitalized when the LOS becomes 65\% longer than the GMLOS. Managerial implications: We demonstrate that, when addressing the consequences of HACs, clinicians also face indirectly a trade-off between reducing readmissions and controlling costs. We proffer LOS as a potential mechanism under hospitals' control for mitigating the adverse effects of HACs on readmission risk. Thus, this study offers guidance to clinicians having to decide when to discharge patients with exposure to HACs.

  abstract = {Python has become the programming language of choice for research and industry projects related to data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

  abstract = {Combinatorial optimization lies at the core of many real-world problems. Especially since the rise of graph neural networks (GNNs), the deep learning community has been developing solvers that derive solutions to NP-hard problems by learning the problem-specific solution structure. However, reproducing the results of these publications proves to be difficult. We make three contributions. First, we present an open-source benchmark suite for the NP-hard Maximum Independent Set problem, in both its weighted and unweighted variants. The suite offers a unified interface to various state-of-the-art traditional and machine learning-based solvers. Second, using our benchmark suite, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the popular guided tree search algorithm by Li et al. [NeurIPS 2018], testing various configurations on small and large synthetic and real-world graphs. By re-implementing their algorithm with a focus on code quality and extensibility, we show that the graph convolution network used in the tree search does not learn a meaningful representation of the solution structure, and can in fact be replaced by random values. Instead, the tree search relies on algorithmic techniques like graph kernelization to find good solutions. Thus, the results from the original publication are not reproducible. Third, we extend the analysis to compare the tree search implementations to other solvers, showing that the classical algorithmic solvers often are faster, while providing solutions of similar quality. Additionally, we analyze a recent solver based on reinforcement learning and observe that for this solver, the GNN is responsible for the competitive solution quality.},

  abstract = {At cross docking terminals incoming deliveries of inbound trucks are unloaded, sorted, moved across the dock and finally loaded onto outbound trucks, which immediately leave the terminal towards their next destination in the distribution chain. Accordingly, a cross dock is a consolidation point in a distribution network, where multiple smaller shipments can be merged to full truck loads in order to realize economies in transportation. In this context, the truck scheduling problem, which decides on the succession of truck processing at the dock doors, is especially important to ensure a rapid turnover and on-time deliveries. Due to its high real-world significance, several truck scheduling procedures have been introduced during recent years, which all treat specific cross dock settings. In order to structure and promote scientific progress, this paper introduces a classification of deterministic truck scheduling. With the help of this classification, existing literature is reviewed and future research needs are identified. Moreover, we represent a yet unexplored class of truck scheduling problems which is highly relevant in real-world distribution networks.},

Growing parcel volumes to be delivered toward customer homes increase the number of delivery vans entering the city centers and thus add to congestion, pollution, and negative health impact. Therefore, it is anything but surprising that in recent years many novel delivery concepts on the last mile have been innovated. Among the most prominent are unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and autonomous delivery robots taking over parcel delivery. This paper surveys established and novel last-mile concepts and puts special emphasis on the decision problems to be solved when setting up and operating each concept. To do so, we systematically record the alternative delivery concepts in a compact notation scheme, discuss the most important decision problems, and survey existing research on operations research methods solving these problems.

We aim to minimize the total completion time. We propose a template to generate iterated greedy algorithms, and use an automatic algorithm configuration to obtain efficient methods. This is the first automated approach in the literature for the non-permutation flow shop scheduling problem. The algorithms start by building a high-quality permutation solution, which is then improved during a second phase that generates non-permutation solutions by changing the job order on some machines. The obtained algorithms are evaluated against two well-known benchmarks from the literature. The results show that they can find better schedules than the state-of-the-art methods for both the permutation and non-permutation flow shop scheduling problems in comparable experimental conditions, as evidenced by comprehensive computational and statistical testing. We conclude that using non-permutation schedules is a viable alternative to reduce the total completion time that production managers should consider.},

However, carrier contracts have to be booked in advance without exact knowledge of what orders will be available for dispatch to reduce the total service cost. The model describing this problem is the variable cost and size bin packing problem with stochastic items. Since it cannot be solved for realistic instances by means of exact solvers, in this paper, we present a new heuristic algorithm able to do so based on machine learning techniques. Several numerical experiments show that the proposed heuristics achieve good performance in a short computational time, thus enabling its real-world usage. Moreover, the comparison against a new and efficient version of progressive hedging proves that the proposed heuristic achieves better results. Finally, we present managerial insights for a case study on parcel delivery in Turin, Italy.},

  abstract = {Metaheuristic algorithms offer unique opportunities in problem solving. Although they do not guarantee optimality, it has been shown by numerous publications that they can achieve excellent results in acceptable time. Particularly in real-life production systems, which are mostly comprised of complex discrete optimization problems, the merit should be finding appropriate and efficient solutions in shorter periods rather than waiting for the optimum solution in whole shift. Accordingly, this paper presents a learning iterated greedy search metaheuristic to minimize the maximum completion time in a hybrid flexible flowshop problem with sequence dependent setup times encountered at a manufacturing plant. The proposed algorithm is comprised of four main phases. The first phase employs NEH heuristic to generate an initial solution. Additionally, in order to introduce diversity, some replications are occasionally allowed to start with random solutions. Destruction mechanism to perturb the current solution is used in the next phase. It is followed by a construction procedure, which is used to repair the partial solution obtained after destruction. Finally, a descent neighborhood search enhanced by a hyper-heuristic based learning is applied to the repaired solution in the fourth phase. Thus, algorithm adaptively learns and promotes the most efficient low-level heuristic out of a heuristics pool and encourages the metaheuristic algorithm in using the promoted low-level heuristic in the final phase. The proposed algorithm along with its several extensions is tested by using real data taken from the mentioned production system. Next, by making use of the same data, the developed algorithms are also compared to eight different algorithms, which are shown to be promising in the related literature. Finally, appropriate statistical tests are applied to demonstrate possible significant improvements among all tested algorithms.},

Moreover, it enables a run-time adaptation of an acceptance condition for each particular move. We investigate the adaptive mechanism where the algorithm accepts the movement of exams in a way that is dependent upon the difficulty of assigning that exam. The overall motivation is to encourage the exploration of a wider region of the search space. We present an analysis of the results of our tests of this technique on two international collections of benchmark exam timetabling problems.

It is a local search algorithm, which accepts non-improving moves when a candidate cost function is better than it was a number of iterations before. This number appears as a single algorithmic input parameter which determines the total processing time of the search procedure. The properties of this method are experimentally studied in this paper with a range of Travelling Salesman and Exam Timetabling benchmark problems. Also, we present a fair comparison of LAHC with well-known search techniques, which employ a cooling schedule: Simulated Annealing (SA), Threshold Accepting (TA) and the Great Deluge Algorithm (GDA). In addition, we discuss the success of the method in winning an international competition to automatically solve the Magic Square problem. Our experiments have shown that the LAHC approach is simple, easy to implement and yet is an effective search procedure. For most of the studied instances (especially for the large sized ones), its average performance is better than competitor methods. Moreover, the LAHC approach has an additional advantage (in contrast to the above cooling schedule based methods) in its scale independence. We present an example where the rescaling of a cost function in the Travelling Salesman Problem dramatically deteriorates the performance of three cooling schedule based techniques, but has absolutely no influence upon the performance of LAHC.},

ParadisEO is of the rare frameworks that provide the most common parallel and distributed models. Their implementation is portable on distributed-memory machines as well as on shared-memory multiprocessors, as it uses standard libraries such as MPI, PVM and PThreads.

  abstract = {Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area in operations research and computer science. Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem instances in isolation, ignoring that they often stem from related data distributions in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), as a key building block for combinatorial tasks, either directly as solvers or by enhancing exact solvers. The inductive bias of GNNs effectively encodes combinatorial and relational input due to their invariance to permutations and awareness of input sparsity. This paper presents a conceptual review of recent key advancements in this emerging field, aiming at optimization and machine learning researchers.},

Most EDAs explicitly use the probabilistic model to sample new solutions without using traditional genetic operators. EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan. The experimental results show that the Self-guided GA is very promising. We also demonstrate that the Self-guided GA can be easily extended to treat other intractable combinatorial problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Local search based meta-heuristics such as variable neighbourhood search have achieved remarkable success in solving complex combinatorial problems. Local search techniques are becoming increasingly popular and are used in a wide variety of meta-heuristics, such as genetic algorithms. Typically, local search iteratively improves a solution by making a series of small moves. Traditionally these methods do not employ any learning mechanism. We treat the selection of a local search neighbourhood as a dynamic multi- armed bandit (D-MAB) problem where learning techniques for solving the D-MAB can be used to guide the local search process. We present a D-MAB neighbourhood search (D-MABNS) which can be embedded within any meta- heuristic or hyperheuristic framework. Given a set of neighbourhoods, the aim of D-MABNS is to adapt the search sequence, testing promising solutions rst. We demonstrate the eectiveness of D-MABNS on two vehicle routing and scheduling problems, the real-world geographically distributed mainte- nance problem (GDMP) and the periodic vehicle routing problem (PVRP). We present comparisons to benchmark instances and give a detailed analysis of parameters, performance and behaviour. Keywords Meta-heuristic Local search Vehicle routing},

  abstract = {Primal heuristics play a crucial role in exact solvers for Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). While solvers are guaranteed to find optimal solutions given sufficient time, real-world applications typically require finding good solutions early on in the search to enable fast decision-making. While much of MIP research focuses on designing effective heuristics, the question of how to manage multiple MIP heuristics in a solver has not received equal attention. Generally, solvers follow hard-coded rules derived from empirical testing on broad sets of instances. Since the performance of heuristics is problem-dependent, using these general rules for a particular problem might not yield the best performance. In this work, we propose the first data-driven framework for scheduling heuristics in an exact MIP solver. By learning from data describing the performance of primal heuristics, we obtain a problem-specific schedule of heuristics that collectively find many solutions at minimal cost. We formalize the learning task and propose an efficient algorithm for computing such a schedule. Compared to the default settings of a state-of-the-art academic MIP solver, we are able to reduce the average primal integral by up to 49\% on two classes of challenging instances.},

  abstract = {Neural approaches for combinatorial optimization (CO) equip a learning mechanism to discover powerful heuristics for solving complex real-world problems. While neural approaches capable of high-quality solutions in a single shot are emerging, state-of-the-art approaches are often unable to take full advantage of the solving time available to them. In contrast, hand-crafted heuristics perform highly effective search well and exploit the computation time given to them, but contain heuristics that are difficult to adapt to a dataset being solved. With the goal of providing a powerful search procedure to neural CO approaches, we propose simulation-guided beam search (SGBS), which examines candidate solutions within a fixed-width tree search that both a neural net-learned policy and a simulation (rollout) identify as promising. We further hybridize SGBS with efficient active search (EAS), where SGBS enhances the quality of solutions backpropagated in EAS, and EAS improves the quality of the policy used in SGBS. We evaluate our methods on well-known CO benchmarks and show that SGBS significantly improves the quality of the solutions found under reasonable runtime assumptions.},

  abstract = {Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are one of the most common logistics problems faced by a wide range of organisations. Parcel delivery organisations are confronted with challenging transportation puzzles due to the increasing number of parcels which must be delivered on a daily basis as a result of ever-increasing levels of online shopping. Even companies whose core business is not transporting goods may also find themselves confronted with having to efficiently solve transportation problems. For example, a made-to-order kitchen manufacturer must not only produce kitchens but also ensure that those kitchens are delivered to customers in a timely and efficient manner. The first attempt to solve the VRP was made by Dantzig et al. (1954). In the years following, many academics have intensively studied the problem. Nevertheless, solving large-scale VRP instances sufficiently fast for real-world scenarios remains challenging. During the last decade, state-of-the-art solution methods have evolved towards genetic algorithms where multiple solutions evolve simultaneously. Other successful methods rely on exploring multiple neighborhoods within a local search algorithm. This PhD introduces a simple yet powerful solution method for solving VRPs: Slack Induction by String Removals (SISRs). SISRs consists of three components: a fleet minimization technique, a ruin method and a recreate method guided by Simulated Annealing (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983). This approach is shown to be remarkable effective across a wide range of VRP variants, while its implementation remains straightforward and flexible enough to accommodate novel routing constraints. Simplified and flexible solution approaches such as SISRs are essential in order to solve real-world routing problems, as such problems may become very computationally complex when special constraints are involved. The Prisoner Transportation Problem, introduced in this PhD thesis, is one such example of a setting in which routing complexity increases considerably due to the restrictions involved when it comes to combining multiple prisoners within a single vehicle. Inspired by real-world VRPs like the Prisoner Transportation Problem (PTP), SISRs successfully contributes to both academic theory as well as vehicle routing optimisation in practice.},

  abstract = {We address the day-ahead scheduling of electricity production units throughout a network imposing N-1 security constraints, which ensures uneventful operation under any single-branch failure. For realistic electric energy systems, this optimization problem, which is mixed-integer linear or nonlinear but convex, involves millions of continuous variables, millions of constraints, and thousands of binary variables. This problem is intractable if state-of-the-art branch-and-cut solvers are used. As a solution methodology, we propose a Benders-type decomposition technique with a dynamically enriched master problem. Such master problem incorporates scheduling (binary) decisions and decisions pertaining to under-contingency operating conditions. The subproblems represent the operation of the system under no failure and single-branch failure. As the algorithm progresses, the master problem incorporates additional under-contingency operating conditions, which increases its computational burden. We use Kron reduction to compact (reducing variables and constraints) the description of the under-contingency operating conditions in the master problem without losing accuracy, which renders major computational gains. The methodology proposed allows solving, within reasonable computing times, instances intractable with state-of-the-art branch-and-cut solvers and decomposition algorithms.},

  abstract = {Last-mile routing refers to the final step in a supply chain, delivering packages from a depot station to the homes of customers. At the level of a single van driver, the task is a traveling salesman problem. But the choice of route may be constrained by warehouse sorting operations, van-loading processes, driver preferences, and other considerations rather than a straightforward minimization of tour length. We propose a simple and efficient penalty-based local search algorithm for route optimization in the presence of such constraints, adopting a technique developed by Helsgaun to extend the Lin\textendash Kernighan\textendash Helsgaun algorithm for the traveling salesman problem to general vehicle routing problems. We apply his technique to handle combinations of constraints obtained from an analysis of historical routing data, enforcing properties that are desired in high-quality solutions. Our code is available under the open-source Massachusetts Institute of Technology license. An earlier version of the code received the \$100,000 top prize in the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge organized in 2021.},

Evolutionary algorithms are among state-of-the-art methods for vehicle routing problems and the diversity management is the key component of many of these algorithms. In our algorithm the diversity level slowly oscillates between its minimum and maximum value, however, whenever a new best solution is found the algorithm switches to decreasing the diversity level in order to intensify the search in the vicinity of the new best solution. We use also an additional population of high quality diverse solutions, which may be used to re-fill the main population when the diversification level is increased. The results of the computational experiment indicate that the proposed mechanism significantly improves the performance of our hybrid evolutionary algorithm on typical CVRPTW benchmarks and that the proposed algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art results presented in the literature.},

  abstract = {The job shop scheduling problem is one of the most studied optimization problems to this day and it becomes more and more important in the light of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) that aims at fully automated production processes. For a long time exact methods like constraint programming had problems to solve real large-scale problem instances and methods of choice were to be found in the area of (meta-) heuristics. However, developments during the last decade improved the performance of state-of-the-art constraint solvers dramatically, to the point that they can be applied also on large-scale instances. The presented work's main target is to elaborate the performance of state-of-the-art constraint solvers with respect to industrial-size job shop scheduling problem instances. To this end, we analyze and compare the performance of two cutting-edge constraint solvers: OR-Tools, an open-source solver developed by Google and recurrent winner of the MiniZinc Challenge, and CP Optimizer, a proprietary constraint solver from IBM targeted at industrial optimization problems. In order to reflect real-world industrial scenarios with heavy workloads like found in the semi-conductor domain, we use novel benchmarks that comprise up to one million operations to be scheduled on up to one thousand machines. The comparison is based on the best makespan (i.e.~completion time) achieved and the time required to solve the problem instances. We test the solvers on single-core and quad-core configurations.},

Such a procedure is made of two main components: a credit assignment mechanism, that computes a reward for each operator at hand based on some characteristics of the past offspring; and an adaptation rule, that modifies the selection mechanism based on the rewards of the different operators. This paper is concerned with the latter, and proposes a new approach for it based on the well-known Multi-Armed Bandit paradigm. However, because the basic Multi-Armed Bandit methods have been developed for static frameworks, a specific Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm is proposed, that hybridizes an optimal MultiArmed Bandit algorithm with the statistical Page-Hinkley test, which enforces the efficient detection of changes in time series. This original Operator Selection procedure is then compared to the state-of-the-art rules known as Probability Matching and Adaptive Pursuit on several artificial scenarios, after a careful sensitivity analysis of all methods. The Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit method is found to outperform the other methods on a scenario from the literature, while on another scenario, the basic Multi-Armed Bandit performs best.},

Statistical analysis with different tools was used to assess the performance and efficiency of mathematical models, emphasizing the analysis of performance profiles. Results showed that mathematical models are efficient, and the position-based model presented the best results for small and large instances during computational experimentation.

We explore an environment in which in-store customers supplement company drivers and deliver online orders on their way home. We consider a highly dynamic and stochastic same-day delivery environment in which online orders as well as in-store customers willing to make deliveries arrive throughout the day. Studying settings in which delivery capacity is uncertain is novel and practically relevant. Our proposed approaches are simple, yet produce high-quality solutions in a short amount of time that can be employed in practice. We develop two rolling horizon dispatching approaches: a myopic one that considers only the state of the system when making decisions, and one that also incorporates probabilistic information about future online order and in-store customer arrivals. We quantify the potential benefits of a novel form of crowdshipping for same-day delivery and demonstrate the value of exploiting probabilistic information about the future. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of this form of crowdshipping and show the impact of changes in environment characteristics, for example, online order arrival pattern, company fleet size, and in-store customer compensation on its performance, that is, service quality and operational cost.},

  abstract = {The combination of large neighbourhood search (LNS) methods with complete search methods has proved to be very effective. By restricting the search to (small) areas around an existing solution, the complete method is often able to quickly improve its solutions. However, developing such a combined method can be time-consuming: While the model of a problem can be expressed in a high-level solver-independent language, the LNS search strategies typically need to be implemented in the search language of the target constraint solvers. In this paper we show how we can simplify this process by (a) extending constraint modelling languages to support solver-independent LNS search definitions, and (b) defining small solver extensions that allow solvers to implement these solver-independent LNS searches. Modellers can then implement an LNS search to be executed in any extended solver, by simply using the modelling language constructs. Experiments show that the resulting LNS searches only introduce a small overhead compared to direct implementations in the search language of the underlying solvers.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic demands (VRPTWSD). The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse, in which routes are designed in the first stage and executed in the second. A failure occurs if the load of the vehicle is insufficient to meet the observed demand of a customer, implying recourse actions to recover feasibility. We consider the classical recourse policy where reactive trips to the depot are made in case of failures and a fixed rule-based recourse policy where, in addition, preventive trips are allowed. These recourse actions delay the vehicle and may cause further failures if the arrival times on the remaining customers of the planned route do not satisfy their time windows. An additional recourse action is used to service the customers whose time windows would be violated in the planned routes. We propose an Integer L-shaped algorithm considering the mentioned recourse actions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tailored exact approach for the VRPTWSD. Computational experiments using 112 benchmark instances evaluate the performance of this algorithm as well as the quality of the stochastic problem solutions. The results indicate significant savings in the solutions when using the fixed rule-based policy and round-trip recourse actions instead of the classical policy. Additionally, the algorithm performed better with the fixed rule-based policy, solving to optimality all instances with up to 34 customers, and taking less time on instances that were solved to optimality with both policies.},

  abstract = {Hyper-heuristics have emerged as a way to raise the level of generality of search techniques for computational search problems. This is in contrast to many approaches, which represent customised methods for a single problem domain or a narrow class of problem instances. The term hyper-heuristic was defined in the early 2000s as a heuristic to choose heuristics, but the idea of designing high-level heuristic methodologies can be traced back to the early 1960s. The current state-of-the-art in hyper-heuristic research comprises a set of methods that are broadly concerned with intelligently selecting or generating a suitable heuristic for a given situation. Hyper-heuristics can be considered as search methods that operate on lower-level heuristics or heuristic components, and can be categorised into two main classes: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. Here we will focus on the first of these two categories, selection hyper-heuristics. This paper gives a brief history of this emerging area, reviews contemporary selection hyper-heuristic literature, and discusses recent selection hyper-heuristic frameworks. In addition, the existing classification of selection hyper-heuristics is extended, in order to reflect the nature of the challenges faced in contemporary research. Unlike the survey on hyper-heuristics published in 2013, this paper focuses only on selection hyper-heuristics and presents critical discussion, current research trends and directions for future research.},

However, no algorithm clearly dominates all its competitors on all problems. Instead, the underlying variety of landscapes of optimization problems calls for a variety of algorithms to solve them efficiently. It is thus of prior importance to have access to mature and flexible software frameworks which allow for an efficient exploration of the algorithm design space. Such frameworks should be flexible enough to accommodate any kind of metaheuristics, and open enough to connect with higher-level optimization, monitoring and evaluation softwares. This article summarizes the features of the Paradiseo framework, a comprehensive C++ free software which targets the development of modular metaheuristics. Paradiseo provides a highly modular architecture, a large set of components, speed of execution and automated algorithm design features, which are key to modern approaches to metaheuristics development.},

We compared this method, which we called threshold accepting (TA), with the well-known simulated annealing (SA) method for discrete optimization. The empirical results demonstrated the superiority of the TA algorithm. In further experiments with the TA principle we discovered two new powerful optimization heuristics: The great deluge algorithm (GDA) and the record-to-record travel (RRT). These algorithms resemble in their structure the formerly studied TA and the SA method. The differences lie in their acceptance rules for worse intermediate solutions. Both, the GDA and the RRT, are essentially one-parameter algorithms; i.e., for the achievement of best possible performance, a good choice is necessary only for a single parameter. This is in contrast for instance to the classical AS algorithm, where it is necessary to choose carefully a certain sequence of parameters, the so-called annealing schedule. The quality of the computational results obtained so far by RRT and GDA shows that the new algorithms behave equally well as TA and thus a fortiori better than SA.},

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP's domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP's facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.},

  abstract = {Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart ``Predict, then Optimize'' (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure\textemdash that is, its objective and constraints\textemdash for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.

  abstract = {This work deals with the parallel machine scheduling problem which consists in the assignment of n jobs on m parallel machines. The most general variant of this problem is when the processing time depends on the machine to which each job is assigned to. This case is known as the unrelated parallel machine problem. Similarly to most of the literature, this paper deals with the minimization of the maximum completion time of the jobs, commonly referred to as makespan (Cmax). Many algorithms and methods have been proposed for this hard combinatorial problem, including several highly sophisticated procedures. By contrast, in this paper we propose a set of simple iterated greedy local search based metaheuristics that produce solutions of very good quality in a very short amount of time. Extensive computational campaigns show that these solutions are, most of the time, better than the current state-of-the-art methodologies by a statistically significant margin.},

First, a situation in which not every available parallel machine should be used and it is desirable to employ only a subset of the parallel machines. This is referred to as ``Not All Machines'' or NAM in short. This environment applies frequently in production shops where capacity exceeds demand or when production capacity can be lent to third companies. Also, NAM can be used to increase production capacity and it is not clear how many additional machines should be acquired. The second studied generalization has been referred to as ``Not All Jobs'' or NAJ. Here, there is no obligation to process all available jobs. We propose Mixed Integer Programming mathematical formulations for both NAM and NAJ, and it is shown that the latter can be effectively solved with modern commercial solvers. We also present three algorithms to solve the NAM problem. These algorithms are compared with the proposed MIP formulation when solved with IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.1. Comprehensive computational and statistical experiments prove that our proposed algorithms significantly improve the results given by the solver.},

One of them is based on a model previously proposed in the literature. The other one, which is based on the resemblance to strip packing problems, is an original contribution of this paper. As the models presented are incapable of solving medium-sized instances to optimality, we propose three matheuristic strategies for each of these two models.

This procedure usually causes a high number of ties (different subsequences with the same best partial makespan) that must be broken via a tie-breaking mechanism. The particular tie-breaking mechanism employed is known to have a great influence in the performance of the NEH, therefore different procedures have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no tie-breaking mechanism has been proposed for the iterated greedy. In our paper, we present a new tie-breaking mechanism based on an estimation of the idle times of the different subsequences in order to pick the one with the lowest value of the estimation. The computational experiments carried out show that this mechanism outperforms the existing ones both for the NEH and the iterated greedy for different CPU times. Furthermore, embedding the proposed tie-breaking mechanism into the iterated greedy provides the most efficient heuristic for the problem so far.},

Therefore, a full set of heuristics efficiently balancing both aspects (quality of solutions and computational effort) has been developed. 12 out of these 14 efficient procedures are composite heuristics based on the LR heuristic by Liu and Reeves (2001), which is of complexity n3m. In our paper, we propose a new heuristic of complexity n2m for the problem, which turns out to produce better results than LR. Furthermore, by replacing the heuristic LR by our proposal in the aforementioned composite heuristics, we obtain a new set of 17 efficient heuristics for the problem, with 15 of them incorporating our proposal. Additionally, we also discuss some issues related to the evaluation of efficient heuristics for the problem and propose an alternative indicator.},

As this problem is known to be NP-hard and a very common layout in real-life manufacturing scenarios, many studies have been proposed in the literature to solve it. These contributions use different solution representations of the feasible schedules, each one with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of them do not guarantee that all feasible semiactive schedules are represented in the space of solutions \textendash thus limiting in principle their effectiveness\textendash{} but, on the other hand, these simpler solution representations possess clear advantages in terms of having consistent neighbourhoods with well-defined neighbourhood moves. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the solution space reduction and the ability to conduct an efficient search in this reduced solution space. This trade-off is determined by two aspects, i.e. the extent of the solution space reduction, and the quality of the schedules left aside by this solution space reduction. In this paper, we analyse the efficiency of the different solution representations employed in the literature for the problem. More specifically, we first establish the size of the space of semiactive schedules achieved by the different solution representations and, secondly, we address the issue of the quality of the schedules that can be achieved by these representations using the optimal solutions given by several MILP models and complete enumeration. The results obtained may contribute to design more efficient algorithms for the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem.},

Servers are renewable secondary resources responsible of executing the setup times of the jobs. Although the use of human supervision is very extensive in real manufacturing scenarios, its study in academia is still very scarce. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, the hybrid flow shop with servers has not been addressed in the literature so far. Hence, we first analyse the problem and identify a number of problem properties. By using these properties, we design two constructive heuristics based on a divide-and-conquer mechanism and four composite heuristics based on memory-based procedures and local search that use an efficient representation of the solutions. In addition, in order to picture the state-of-the-art of the most efficient heuristics for this problem, we re-implement and adapt the most promising heuristics from related scheduling problems. All these heuristics, a total of 31, are compared in an extensive computational evaluation with 1620 instances. The results show the excellent performance of the heuristics proposed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the problem of makespan minimisation in a permutation flowshop where the maximum tardiness is limited by a given upper bound. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, we focus our attention on approximate approaches that allow obtaining good heuristic solutions to the problem. We first review the related literature and then propose a new algorithm. The algorithm is found to be competitive with the existing algorithms in terms of quality of the solution as well as in terms of the number of feasible solutions found.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the development of customised and realistic manufacturing scheduling systems. More specifically, we focus onto a key element that may help driving their efficient design and implementation: i.e., the set of building blocks that should include a generic scheduling system and its interconnections, a set collectively known as the architecture of a system. To do so, we first analyse existing contributions on the topic together with papers describing different functional requirements of scheduling systems. These contributions are then discussed and classified, and a modular architecture for manufacturing scheduling systems is proposed. This proposal updates, extends and refines the well-known architecture proposed earlier by Pinedo and Yen's [Pinedo, M.L., Yen, B.P.-C., 1997. On the design and development of object-oriented scheduling systems. Annals of Operations Research 70 (1), 359\textendash 378], and serves to integrate the different requirements identified in the literature review.},

  abstract = {The book is devoted to the problem of manufacturing scheduling, which is the efficient allocation of jobs (orders) over machines (resources) in a manufacturing facility. It offers a comprehensive and integrated perspective on the different aspects required to design and implement systems to efficiently and effectively support manufacturing scheduling decisions. Obtaining economic and reliable schedules constitutes the core of excellence in customer service and efficiency in manufacturing operations. Therefore, scheduling forms an area of vital importance for competition in manufacturing companies. However, only a fraction of scheduling research has been translated into practice, due to several reasons. First, the inherent complexity of scheduling has led to an excessively fragmented field in which different sub problems and issues are treated in an independent manner as goals themselves, therefore lacking a unifying view of the scheduling problem. Furthermore, mathematical brilliance and elegance has sometimes taken preference over practical, general purpose, hands-on approaches when dealing with these problems. Moreover, the paucity of research on implementation issues in scheduling has restricted translation of valuable research insights into industry. Manufacturing Scheduling Systems: An Integrated View on Models, Methods and Tools presents the different elements constituting a scheduling system, along with an analysis the manufacturing context in which the scheduling system is to be developed. Examples and case studies from real implementations of scheduling systems are presented in order to drive the presentation of the theoretical insights. The book is intended for an ample readership including industrial engineering/operations post-graduate students and researchers, business managers, and readers seeking an introduction to the field},

Although numerous scientific contributions have been produced on this area over the last decades, the wide extension of the problems covered and the lack of a unified approach have led to a situation where the state of the art in the field is unclear, which in turn hinders new research and makes translating the scientific knowledge into practice difficult. In this paper, we propose a unified notation for assembly scheduling models that encompass all concurrent-type scheduling problems. Using this notation, the existing contributions are reviewed and classified into a single framework, so a comprehensive, unified picture of the field is obtained. In addition, a number of conclusions regarding the state of the art in the topic are presented, as well as some opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Despite the many optimization algorithms available in the literature and the several different approaches that study them, understanding the behaviour of an optimization algorithm and explaning its results are fundamental open questions in Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence. We argue that the body of literature available is already very rich, and the main obstacle to the advancements towards an answer to those questions is its fragmentation. In this work we propose a causal framework that relates the entities involved in the solution of an optimization problem. We show how this conceptual framework can be used to relate many approaches aimed at understanding how algorithms work, and how it can be used to address open problems, both theoretical and practical. In particular, we use it to show how to make use of data collected in past experiments to automatically infer plausible algorithms for unseen problems, and provide a proof-of-concept using a simple stochastic local search.},

In this paper we provide a review of both classical and modern local search neighborhoods for this class of problems. The intention of this paper is not only to give an overview but to classify and analyze the structure of different neighborhoods. The analysis is based on a formal representation of VRSP solutions given by a unifying giant-tour model. We describe neighborhoods implicitly by a set of transformations called moves and show how moves can be decomposed further into partial moves. The search method has to compose these partial moves into a complete move in an efficient way. The goal is to find a local best neighbor and to reach a local optimum as quickly as possible. This can be achieved by search methods, which do not scan all neighbor solutions explicitly. Our analysis shows how the properties of the partial moves and the constraints of the VRSP influences the choice of an appropriate search technique.},

In this problem, each job has a profit, cost and must be assigned to at most one machine in such a way that total profit is maximized. In addition, the total cost has to be less than or equal to a budget level. Computational tests are performed on a real-life case study prepared in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Our initial investigations show that the pure CP model is very efficient in obtaining good quality feasible solutions but, fails to report the optimal solution for the majority of the problem instances. On the other hand, the two logic-based Benders decomposition algorithms are able to obtain near optimal solutions for 86 instances out of 90 examinees. For the remaining instances, they provide a feasible solution. Further investigations show the high quality of the solutions obtained by the pure CP model.},

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is an extension of the well-known vehicle routing problem with a central depot. The objective function of the VRPTW considered here combines the minimization of the number of vehicles (primary criterion) and the total travel distance (secondary criterion). In this paper, a two-phase procedural approach for solving the VRPTW is parallelized. The aim of the first phase is the minimization of the number of vehicles by means of a (1, {$\lambda$})-evolution strategy, whereas in the second phase the total distance is minimized using a tabu search algorithm. The parallelization of this sequential hybrid procedure follows the concept of cooperative autonomy, i.e., several autonomous sequential solution procedures cooperate through the exchange of solutions. However, exchanges of solutions lead to the corresponding jumps in the solution space only if certain acceptance conditions are met. The good performance of both the sequential and the parallel approach is demonstrated by means of well-known and new benchmark problems.},

We analyse some of the existing lower bounds for the problem, including the ``job-based'' and ``machine-based'' bounds, a bound from linear programming (LP), and a recent bound of Kumar and co-authors. We show that the Kumar et~al.~bound dominates the machine-based bound, but the LP bound is stronger still. On the other hand, the LP bound does not, in general, dominate the job-based bound. Based on this, we devise simple iterative procedures for strengthening the Kumar et~al.~and LP bounds. Computational results are encouraging. In particular, we are able to obtain improved lower bounds for the ``hard, small'' instances of Vallada, Ruiz and Framinan.},

  abstract = {6.1 Introduction In recent years several metaheuristics have been proposed for the VRP. These are general solution procedures that explore the solution space to identify good solutions and often embed some of the standard route construction and improvement heuristics described in Chapter 5. In a major departure from classical approaches, metaheuristics allow deteriorating and even infeasible intermediary solutions in the course of the search process. The best known metaheuristics developed for the VRP typically identify better local optima than earlier heuristics, but they also tend to be more time consuming. We are aware of six main types of metaheuristic that have been applied to the VRP: Simulated Annealing (SA), Deterministic Annealing (DA), Tabu Search (TS), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Systems (AS), and Neural Networks (NN). The first three algorithms start from an initial solution x1 and move at each iteration t from xt to a solution xt+1 in the neighborhood N (xt) of xt, until a stopping condition is satisfied. If {$f$} (x) denotes the cost of x, then {$f$} (xt+1) is not necessarily less than {$f$} (xt). As a result, care must be taken to avoid cycling. GA examines at each step a population of solutions. Each population is derived from the preceding one by combining its best elements and discarding the worst. Ant systems is a constructive approach in which several new solutions are created at each iteration using some of the information gathered at previous iterations. As was noted by Taillard et al. [63], tabu search, genetic algorithms, and ant systems are methods that record, as the search proceeds, information on solutions encountered and use it to obtain improved solutions. Neural networks is a learning mechanism that gradually adjusts a set of weights until an acceptable solution is reached.},

  abstract = {In this work we propose an efficient branch-and-bound (B\&B) algorithm for the permutation flow-shop problem (PFSP) with makespan objective. We present a new node decomposition scheme that combines dynamic branching and lower bound refinement strategies in a computationally efficient way. To alleviate the computational burden of the two-machine bound used in the refinement stage, we propose an online learning-inspired mechanism to predict promising couples of bottleneck machines. The algorithm offers multiple choices for branching and bounding operators and can explore the search tree either sequentially or in parallel on multi-core CPUs. In order to empirically determine the most efficient combination of these components, a series of computational experiments with 600 benchmark instances is performed. A main insight is that the problem size, as well as interactions between branching and bounding operators substantially modify the trade-off between the computational requirements of a lower bound and the achieved tree size reduction. Moreover, we demonstrate that parallel tree search is a key ingredient for the resolution of large problem instances, as strong super-linear speedups can be observed. An overall evaluation using two well-known benchmarks indicates that the proposed approach is superior to previously published B\&B algorithms. For the first benchmark we report the exact resolution \textendash{} within less than 20~minutes \textendash{} of two instances defined by 500 jobs and 20 machines that remained open for more than 25 years, and for the second a total of 89 improved best-known upper bounds, including proofs of optimality for 74 of them.},

In this paper, we present our attempts to solve these instances to optimality using parallel Branch-and-Bound (BB) on the GPU-accelerated Jean Zay supercomputer. We report the exact solution of 11 previously unsolved problem instances and improved upper bounds for eight instances. The solution of these problems requires both algorithmic improvements and leveraging the computing power of peta-scale high-performance computing platforms. The challenge consists in efficiently performing parallel depth-first traversal of a highly irregular and fine-grained search tree on distributed systems composed of hundreds of massively parallel accelerator devices and multicore processors. We present and discuss the design and implementation of our permutation-based BB and experimentally evaluate its parallel performance on up to 384 V100 GPUs (2 million CUDA cores) and 3840 CPU cores. The optimality proof for the largest solved instance requires about 64 CPU-years of computation\textemdash using 256 GPUs and over 4 million parallel search agents, the traversal of the search tree is completed in 13 hours, exploring  339\texttimes{} 10 12 339\texttimes 1012  nodes.},

However, because most rollout implementations are closely tied to specific problems, the visibility of advances in rollout methods is limited, thereby making it difficult for researchers in other fields to extract general procedures and apply them to different areas. We present a rollout algorithm framework to make recent advances in rollout methods more accessible to researchers seeking heuristic policies for large-scale, finite-horizon SDPs. We formalize rollout variants exploiting the pre- and post-decision state variables as a means of overcoming computational limitations imposed by large state and action spaces. We present a unified analytical discussion, generalizing results from the literature and introducing new results that relate the performance of the rollout variants to one another. Relative to the literature, our policy-based approach to presenting and proving results makes a closer connection to the underpinnings of dynamic programming. Finally, we illustrate our framework and analytical results via application to a dynamic and stochastic multi-compartment knapsack problem.},

We present a mathematical programming formulation of the model that represents the logistics management problem. As solving the exact model is computationally expensive, we opt for a hybrid heuristic approach that first uses an insertion heuristic algorithm to obtain an initial solution and then improvement processes are performed using the so-called simulated annealing metaheuristic. We have built a graphical interface that allows easy use of the system and, in particular, efficient post-optimality analysis. Moreover, this interface can easily interface with other management tools. The utility of our model is shown with real and simulated data sets.},

In a no-wait environment, a job must be processed from start to completion, without any interruption either on or between machines. Blocking occurs when a job, having completed processing on a machine, remains on the machine until a downstream machine becomes available for processing. A no-wait or blocking production environment typically arises from characteristics of the processing technology itself, or from the absence of storage capacity between operations of a job. In this review paper, we describe several well-documented applications of no-wait and blocking scheduling models and illustrate some ways in which the increasing use of modern manufacturing methods gives rise to other applications. We review the computational complexity of a wide variety of no-wait and blocking scheduling problems and describe several problems which remain open as to complexity. We study several deterministic flowshop, jobshop, and openshop problems and describe efficient and enumerative algorithms, as well as heuristics and results about their performance. The literature on stochastic no-wait and blocking scheduling problems is also reviewed. Finally, we provide some suggestions for future research directions.},

Therefore, the multifactory production scheduling environment, so-called the distributed scheduling problem, is gaining more and more attention from the authors. In this context, which factory will manufacture which product is an important decision making process. The distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) provided with real life applications has attracted attention of the researchers for nearly one decade as one of the special cases of the distributed scheduling problem. In the current literature, approximation methods have been intensely used for solving the DPFSP and only one paper containing the exact solution methods has been published to solve this problem. In this paper, the best mathematical formulations available in the current literature has been further improved and traditional and hybrid Benders decomposition algorithms are presented through the proposed new mathematical model. The developed new model is a position based model intended for restricting the domains of decision variables and assigning jobs to sequential positions in the related decision variables. The proposed hybrid Benders decomposition algorithm consists of the hybridization of NEH2\_en local search algorithm, a mathematical model to find the upper bound for the number of positions used in the related decision variables, the LS3 algorithm, with the Benders decomposition algorithms. The new and best exact methods available in the literature are compared with each other by using the benchmark data sets and the experimental results showed that the new exact methods developed in this paper are superior to the existing exact methods in all aspects. In this paper, 18 new best solutions are founded for the DPFSP.},

  abstract = {The flowshop group scheduling problem (FGSP) has become a hot research problem owing to its practical applications in modern industry in recent years. The FGSP can be regarded as a combination of two coupled sub-problems. One is the group scheduling sub-problem with sequence-dependent setup times. The other is the job scheduling sub-problem within each group. A mixed integer linear programming model is built for the FGSP with the makespan criterion. Based on the problem-specific knowledge, i.e., the sequence-dependent group setup times are greater than the processing time of jobs, and the number of machines is small, the group scheduling sub-problem is approximated into an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Then, a matheuristic algorithm (MA) is proposed by integrating a branch-and-cut algorithm and an iterated greedy (IG) algorithm, where the branch-and-cut algorithm is used to generate the optimal Hamiltonian circuit for sub-group sequences of a group sequence obtained by the IG. On 405 test instances, the proposed MA performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature.},

These constant changes that happen all the time, often, lead to an increase in costs and/or a decrease in efficiency. Most of the uncertainty in cross-docks is caused by un-known truck arrival times. In this study we address the problem of scheduling incoming and outgoing trucks at a cross-dock facility, when vehicle arrival times are unknown, through a cost-stable scheduling strategy. Two meta-heuristics, MODE and NSGA-II, are used for solving the designed sample problems and are compared with a random search based genetic algorithm existing in the literature. Finally, performance of each algorithm is measured and analyzed using four metrics: quality, spacing, diversification and mean ideal distance. The results indicate that the proposed model MODE algorithm performs better in comparison with the other two methods.},

  abstract = {A Tutorial on Value Function Approximation for Stochastic and Dynamic Transportation Arne Heinold School of Economics and Business, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany Abstract This paper provides an introductory tutorial on Value Function Approximation (VFA), a solution class from Approximate Dynamic Programming. VFA describes a heuristic way for solving se- quential decision processes like a Markov Decision Process. Real-world problems in supply chain management (and beyond) containing dynamic and stochastic elements might be modeled as such processes, but large-scale instances are intractable to be solved to optimality by enumeration due to the curses of dimensionality. VFA can be a proper method for these cases and this tutorial is designed to ease its use in research, practice, and education. For this, the tutorial describes VFA in the context of stochastic and dynamic transportation and makes three main contributions. First, it gives a concise theoretical overview of VFA's fundamental concepts, outlines a generic VFA algorithm, and briefly discusses advanced topics of VFA. Second, the VFA algorithm is applied to the taxicab problem that describes an easy-to-understand transportation planning task. Detailed step-by-step results are presented for a small-scale instance, allowing readers to gain an intuition about VFA's main principles. Third, larger instances are solved by enhancing the basic VFA algo- rithm demonstrating its general capability to approach more complex problems. The experiments are done with artificial instances and the respective Python scripts are part of an electronic ap- pendix. Overall, the tutorial provides the necessary knowledge to apply VFA to a wide range of stochastic and dynamic settings and addresses likewise researchers, lecturers, tutors, students, and practitioners.},

  abstract = {This report describes the implementation of an extension of the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun TSP solver for solving constrained traveling salesman and vehicle routing problems. The extension, which is called LKH-3, is able to solve a variety of well-known problems, including the sequential ordering problem (SOP), the traveling repairman problem (TRP), variants of the multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP), as well as vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with capacity, time windows, pickup-and-delivery and distance constraints. The implementation of LKH-3 builds on the idea of transforming the problems into standard symmetric traveling salesman problems and handling constraints by means of penalty functions. Extensive testing on benchmark instances from the literature has shown that LKH-3 is effective. Best known solutions are often obtained, and in some cases, new best solutions are found. The program is free of charge for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code. A comprehensive library of benchmark instances and the best obtained results for these instances can also be downloaded.},

  abstract = {Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) heuristics are among the most powerful but also most expensive heuristics for mixed integer programs (MIP). Ideally, a solver adaptively concentrates its limited computational budget by learning which LNS heuristics work best for the MIP problem at hand. To this end, this work introduces Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for MIP, a primal heuristic that acts as a framework for eight popular LNS heuristics such as Local Branching and Relaxation Induced Neighborhood Search (RINS). We distinguish the available LNS heuristics by their individual search spaces, which we call auxiliary problems. The decision which auxiliary problem should be executed is guided by selection strategies for the multi armed bandit problem, a related optimization problem during which suitable actions have to be chosen to maximize a reward function. In this paper, we propose an LNS-specific reward function to learn to distinguish between the available auxiliary problems based on successful calls and failures. A second, algorithmic enhancement is a generic variable fixing prioritization, which ALNS employs to adjust the subproblem complexity as needed. This is particularly useful for some LNS problems which do not fix variables by themselves. The proposed primal heuristic has been implemented within the MIP solver SCIP. An extensive computational study is conducted to compare different LNS strategies within our ALNS framework on a large set of publicly available MIP instances from the MIPLIB and Coral benchmark sets. The results of this simulation are used to calibrate the parameters of the bandit selection strategies. A second computational experiment shows the computational benefits of the proposed ALNS framework within the MIP solver SCIP.},

Given the surge of e-commerce and the ever-increasing volume of goods to be delivered, we explore possible logistic solutions by proposing algorithms to add parcel-transport services to ride-hailing systems. Toward this end, we present and solve mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of the share-a-ride problem and quantitatively analyze the service revenues and use of vehicle resources. We create five scenarios that represent joint transportation situations for parcels and people, and that consider different densities in request types and different requirements for vehicle resources. For one scenario, we propose an alternative MILP formulation that significantly reduces computation times. The proposed model also improves scalability by solving instances with 260\% more requests than those solved with general MILP. The results show that the greatest profit margins occur when several parcels share trips with customers. In contrast, with all metrics considered, the worst results occur when parcels and people are transported in separate dedicated vehicles. The integration of parcel services in ride-hailing systems also reduces vehicle waiting times when the number of parcel requests exceeds the number of ride-hailing customers.},

This complexity is now multiplied by the challenge of evaluating such actions with respect to their effectiveness given future dynamism and uncertainty, a potentially ideal case for reinforcement learning (RL) well-known by the computer science community. For solving SDVRPs, joint work of both communities is needed, but as we show, essentially non-existing. Both communities focus on their individual strengths leaving potential for improvement.

The complexity of finding efficient routing actions is multiplied by the challenge of evaluating such actions with respect to their effectiveness given future dynamism and uncertainty. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising tool for evaluating actions but it is not designed for searching the complex and combinatorial action space. Thus, past work on RL for SDVRP has either restricted the action space, that is solving only subproblems by RL and everything else by established heuristics, or focused on problems that reduce to resource allocation problems. For solving real-world SDVRPs, new strategies are required that address the combined challenge of combinatorial, constrained action space and future uncertainty, but as our findings suggest, such strategies are essentially non-existing. Our survey paper shows that past work relied either on action-space restriction or avoided routing actions entirely and highlights opportunities for more holistic solutions.},

The aim is to estimate the expected value of treating the problems as a whole, rather than making decisions sequentially. In particular, the following research questions are posed: What is the expected cost reduction when combining production, inventory, and routing in a single modeling framework, compared to solving the problems individually in a sequence? Under which circumstances is it most beneficial to tackle an integrated problem? In other words, the goal is to establish whether the solutions obtained by the integration are clearly better than approximate solutions obtained by a more simplified process, and if so, under which circumstances this difference is the most pronounced. To answer these research questions, a systematic review was performed, resulting in a set of 20 relevant articles that were analyzed in depth. For the first research question, computational results from 15 articles were obtained and analyzed through a meta-analysis. The analysis estimated an expected cost savings provided by integration of 11.08\%, with a 95\% confidence interval of [6.58\%, 15.58\%]. For the second research question, individual results obtained via sensitivity analyses in 20 relevant articles were summarized qualitatively, enabling insights into how the potential savings by integration is influenced by parameters such as the degrees of freedom, the cost, and the capacity.},

Unloading queue at depot significantly compicates this problem since it makes a trip involve traveling, waiting, and unloading stages. We first formulate this problem into a trip-based set partitioning model, which has two sets of mutual exclusion constraints. To solve the model, we propose a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm (BPC), in which the linear relaxation of the model is solved by column generation, and moreover, the relaxation gap is tightened by incorporating rounded capacity inequalities. Particularly, the mutual exclusion constraints induce a new and challening pricing problem, and we design a novel label-setting algorithm with tailored label structure to solve it. We conduct compuational experiments on a set of random instances generated from the Solomon's benchmark, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

A bi-objective mixed-integer programming model with maximizing total profits and minimizing total weighted earliness and tardiness has been established. We develop a hybrid collaborative framework to solve this problem, which nests the collaborative mechanism in an optimization mode based on the hybrid algorithm. In the collaborative mechanism, a property on the ideal optimal departure time of the tour is first proposed, based on which an exact strategy is developed to simultaneously coordinate batch manufacturing and tour departure schedules. High-quality integrated solutions are provided by simultaneously making both production scheduling and vehicle routing decisions. Then, in order to get the best integrated solution, we adopt a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm improved by an adaptive large neighborhood search strategy based on the specific problem and coding form to realize the optimization mode. Computational experiments are performed on a dataset containing 30 instances of various scales. The results show that the proposed hybrid collaborative framework performs well in cardinality, convergence, distribution and spread, which is a very competitive method to solve this problem.},

The work is focused on strong modeling capabilities as well as efficient solution procedures to be used in all kinds of metaheuristics. From the modeling point of view, the framework covers a variety of standard VRP types with classical constraints such as capacity, distance, route length, time window, pairing, and precedence constraints, but also nonstandard ``rich'' VRPs. From the methodological point of view, local search (LS) is the key solver engine to be used in heuristic solution procedures. First and foremost, the framework introduces two generic techniques for the efficient exploration of edge- and node-exchange neighborhoods. New preprocessing methods allow {$\mathscr{O}$}(n               k               ) neighborhoods to be searched in time complexity {$\mathscr{O}$}(n               k               ), i.e., without an additional effort for feasibility testing in the worst case. Moreover, for accelerating LS in the average case, Irnich et al. [Irnich, S., B. Funke, T. Gr\"unert. 2006. Sequential search and its application to vehicle-routing problems. Comput. Oper. Res. 33 2405\textendash 2429] have introduced sequential search that is here adapted to cope with rich VRPs (complex side constraints). Computational tests on different types of VRPs indicate that the proposed techniques are highly efficient. Sequential search procedures outperform the currently most efficient search methods, which are based on lexicographic search, on large-scale instances and for nearly all types of neighborhoods by factors of between 10 and 1,000.},

This book introduces the concepts, tools, and skills that researchers need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Based on the practical experiences of its authors, who collectively have spent several decades teaching software skills to scientists, it covers everything graduate-level researchers need to automate their workflows, collaborate with colleagues, ensure that their results are trustworthy, and publish what they have built so that others can build on it. The book assumes only a basic knowledge of Python as a starting point, and shows readers how it, the Unix shell, Git, Make, and related tools can give them more time to focus on the research they actually want to do. Research Software Engineering with Python can be used as the main text in a one-semester course or for self-guided study. A running example shows how to organize a small research project step by step; over a hundred exercises give readers a chance to practice these skills themselves, while a glossary defining over two hundred terms will help readers find their way through the terminology.

Demands are revealed upon the vehicle arrival at customer locations. As a result, a vehicle may reach a customer and does not have sufficient capacity to collect the realized demand. Such a situation is referred to as a failure. In this paper the following recourse action is then applied when failure occurs: the vehicle returns to the depot to unload and resumes its planned route at the point of failure. The capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD) consists of minimizing the sum of the planned routes cost and of the expected recourse cost. The VRPSD is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model and solved by means of an integer L-shaped algorithm. This paper introduces three lower bounding functionals based on the generation of general partial routes, as well as an exact separation procedure to identify violated cuts. Extensive computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as measured by a substantial reduction in the number of feasible solutions that have to be explicitly eliminated. This translates into a higher proportion of instances solved to optimality, reduced optimality gaps, and lower computing times.},

This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning method to address this question. We introduce a new hyperheuristic scheme, termed Bandit VNS, inspired by the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB), a particular type of a single state reinforcement learning problem. In Bandit VNS, we utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic and enhance it by a hyperheuristic strategy. We examine several variations of the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to create a reliable strategy for adaptive neighborhood selection. Furthermore, we utilize Adaptive Windowing, a state of the art algorithm to estimate and detect changes in the data stream. Bandit VNS is designed for effective parallelization and encourages cooperation between agents to produce the best solution quality. We demonstrate this concept's advantages in accuracy and speed by extensive experimentation using the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. We compare the novel scheme's performance against the conventional General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic in terms of the CPU time and solution quality. The Bandit VNS method shows excellent results and reaches significantly higher performance metrics when applied to well-known benchmark instances. Our experiments show that, our approach achieves an improvement of more than 25\% in solution quality when compared to the General Variable Neighborhood Search method using standard library instances of medium and large size.},

By using millions of simulation trials and a new effective lower bound on the shortest makespan, we observe relatively high optimality rates of the three heuristics for small values of m. Rather surprisingly, for larger values of n, the heuristics become more frequently optimal as n increases.

This metaheuristic basically employs single local search and perturbation operators for finding the (near-) optimal solution. In this paper, by incorporating multiple local search and perturbation operators, we explore the use of reinforcement learning, and more specifically Q-learning as a machine learning technique, to intelligently select the most appropriate search operator(s) at each stage of the search process. The Q-learning is separately used for both local search operator selection and perturbation operator selection. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested through a comparative analysis against a set of benchmark algorithms. Finally, we show that intelligently selecting the search operators not only provides better solutions with lower optimality gaps but also accelerates the convergence of the algorithms toward promising solutions.},

This integration aims to lead meta-heuristics toward an efficient, effective, and robust search and improve their performance in terms of solution quality, convergence rate, and robustness. Since various integration methods with different purposes have been developed, there is a need to review the recent advances in using machine learning techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning techniques in the design of different elements of meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution, parameter setting, and cooperation. First, we describe the key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by promising future research directions.},

While this might save costs, it also leads to uncertainty in the available workforce and their behavior. Finally, micro-consolidation centers enable the use of smaller, cheaper, and emission-friendlier vehicles, but lead to more complex planning and operations.

However, minimising total tardiness in DPFSP, a very essential and relevant objective for today's customer-orientated market, has not been studied much. In this paper, we address the DPFSP with the total tardiness criterion. We present a mixed-integer linear programming model, two heuristics, hybrid discrete Harris hawks optimisation and an enhanced variant of iterated greedy algorithm to solve the considered problem. Problem-specific knowledge is explored and effective technologies, such as path relinking and random sub-sequence/single-point local search, are employed to improve the presented algorithms. The operators and parameters of the algorithms are analysed and calibrated using the design of experiments. To evaluate the performance, the well-known benchmark problem set of Naderi and Ruiz for DPFSP is extended with due dates. We compare the presented algorithms against seven other well-known meta-heuristics from the literature. Statistically sound results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms for the considered problem.},

Recently, Hong et al.

We propose a new constraint programming (CP) formulation for the SCC scheduling problem and develop an algorithm, called Iterated Greedy CP (IGC), which uses the framework of IGM but replaces the MIP model with our CP model. When we solve the CP subproblems iteratively, we also refine them by adding appropriate constraints, reducing the domains of the variables, and giving the variables hints derived from the current solution. From computational experiments in various settings, we show that IGC implemented with an open-source CP solver can be competitive with IGM running on a commercial MIP solver.},

The DDWP models an order dispatching problem faced by a distribution center, where orders arise dynamically throughout a service day and must be delivered by day's end. At each decision epoch (wave), the system's operator chooses whether or not to dispatch a single vehicle loaded with orders ready for service in order to minimize vehicle travel costs and penalties for unserved requests. We formulate an arc-based integer programming model and design local search heuristics to solve a deterministic DDWP where order arrival times are known in advance. We use the deterministic variant to design an a priori solution approach, and provide two approaches to obtain dynamic policies using the a priori solution. We test and compare solution approaches on two sets of instances with different geography scenarios, size, information dynamism, and order timing variability. The computational results suggest that our best dynamic policy can reduce the average cost of an a priori policy by 9.1\% and substantially improves the fraction of orders delivered (order coverage), demonstrating the importance of reactive optimization for dynamic SDD services. We also analyze the tradeoff between two common SDD objectives: total cost minimization versus order coverage maximization. We find structural differences in the dispatch frequency and route duration of solutions for the two different objectives, and demonstrate empirically that small increases in order coverage may require substantial increases in vehicle travel cost.},

At any dispatch epoch (wave), the information available to the decision maker is (1) a set of known, open requests that remain unfulfilled, and (2) a set of potential requests that may arrive later in the service day. At each wave, the decision maker decides whether or not to dispatch a vehicle, and if so, which subset of open requests to serve, with the objective of minimizing expected vehicle operating costs and penalties for unserved requests. We consider the DDWP with a single delivery vehicle and request destinations on a line, where vehicle operating times and costs depend only on the distance between points. We propose an efficient dynamic programming approach for the deterministic variant, and leverage it to design an optimal a priori policy with predetermined routes for the stochastic case. We then show that fully dynamic policies may perform arbitrarily better than a priori ones, and propose heuristics and dual bounds for this case.

  abstract = {We study request acceptance dynamics in same-day delivery systems by formulating the Dynamic Dispatch Waves Problem with Immediate Acceptance, which models integrated management and distribution for dynamically arriving customer requests. We consider an e-commerce platform that attempts to serve most customers with same-day delivery service. When a shopper attempts to place an order, a decision is made immediately to offer same-day delivery service (accept the request) or to deny service. Accepted requests are not available for immediate dispatch; they must be processed (picked and packed) before they are loaded for delivery. Vehicle routes are updated dynamically and serve each accepted delivery request no later than the end of the service day. In this work, we limit the study to the case of a single vehicle serving requests, potentially using multiple trips from the distribution center. The objective is to make request acceptance and distribution decisions that minimize the expected sum of vehicle travel costs and penalties for service denials. We develop a framework for dynamic decision policies over continuous time for such systems, where a feasible vehicle dispatch plan is redesigned and used to guide decisions over time. We design methods for determining an initial optimal a priori plan and for updating the plan using a heuristic roll-out procedure. Our methods are tested on a family of simulated instances against two common-sense benchmarks and an infeasible relaxed policy that allows the dispatcher to delay the acceptance or rejection of a request until the end of the service day. We demonstrate in our computational study that the cost-per-request of the best benchmark policy is on average 9.7\% higher than our proposed dynamic policy and furthermore that the dynamic policy leads to only a 4.4\% cost increase over the infeasible relaxed policy lower bound.},

  abstract = {For providers to stay competitive in a context of continued growth in e-retail sales and increasing customer expectations, same-day delivery options have become very important. Typically, with same-day delivery, customers purchase online and expect to receive their ordered goods within a narrow delivery time span. Providers thus experience substantial operational challenges to run profitable tours and generate sufficiently high contribution margins to cover overhead costs. We address these challenges by combining a demand-management approach with an online tour-planning approach for same-day delivery. More precisely, in order to reserve capacity for high-value customer orders and to guide customer choices toward efficient delivery operations, we propose a demand-management approach that explicitly optimizes the combination of delivery spans and prices which are presented to each incoming customer request. The approach includes an anticipatory sample-scenario based value approximation, which incorporates a direct online tour-planning heuristic. It does not require extensive offline learning and is scalable to realistically sized instances with multiple vehicles. In a comprehensive computational study, we show that our anticipatory approach can improve the contribution margin by up to 50\% compared to a myopic benchmark approach. We also show that solving an explicit pricing optimization problem is a beneficial component of our approach. More precisely, it outperforms both a pure availability control and a simple pricing rule based on opportunity costs. The latter idea is one used in other approaches for related dynamic pricing problems dealt with in the literature.},

Arrival time of an inbound truck is considered to be unknown. In particular, the cross-dock operator only acknowledges the arrival time window of each truck, i.e., the lower and upper bounds of any inbound truck's arrival time. In absence of any additional information, the cross-dock operator may use three approaches to determine a scheduling strategy: deterministic approach (which assumes expected truck arrival times are equal to their mid-arrival time windows), pessimistic approach (which assumes the worst truck arrivals will be realized), and optimistic approach (which assumes the best truck arrivals will be realized). In this paper, a bi-level optimization problem is formulated for pessimistic and optimistic approaches. We discuss a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the truck-to-door assignments for given truck arrival times, which solves the deterministic approach. Then the GA is modified to solve the bi-level formulations of the pessimistic and the optimistic approaches. Our numerical studies show that an hybrid approach regarding the pessimistic and the optimistic approaches may outperform all of the three approaches in certain cases.},

  abstract = {The recently presented idea to learn heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems is promising as it can save costly development. However, to push this idea towards practical implementation, we need better models and better ways of training. We contribute in both directions: we propose a model based on attention layers with benefits over the Pointer Network and we show how to train this model using REINFORCE with a simple baseline based on a deterministic greedy rollout, which we find is more efficient than using a value function. We significantly improve over recent learned heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), getting close to optimal results for problems up to 100 nodes. With the same hyperparameters, we learn strong heuristics for two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Orienteering Problem (OP) and (a stochastic variant of) the Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP), outperforming a wide range of baselines and getting results close to highly optimized and specialized algorithms.},

The code has been optimized and we used different schedules for growing the size of neighborhood and population based on instance characteristics. For the VRPTW with distance-only objective (not minimizing vehicles) we found several improvements of best known solutions (BKS) for Gehring \& Homberger [3] benchmark instances.

The approach combines Large Neighborhood Search with a portfolio of neighborhoods and completion strategies together with Machine Learning techniques to converge on the most efficient neighborhoods and completion strategies for the problem being solved. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of 21 scheduling benchmarks, most of which are well established in the scheduling community. Despite the generality of the approach, for 17 benchmarks out of 21, its mean relative distance to state-of-the-art problem specific algorithms is less than 4\%. It even outperforms state-of-the-art problem-specific algorithms on 7 benchmarks clearly showing that our algorithm offers a valuable compromise between robustness and performance.},

  abstract = {There are significant research opportunities in the integration of Machine Learning (ML) methods and Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we focus on metaheuristics to solve COPs that have an important learning component. These algorithms must explore a solution space and learn from the information they obtain in order to find high-quality solutions. Among the metaheuristics, we study Hyper-Heuristics (HHs), algorithms that, given a number of low-level heuristics, iteratively select and apply heuristics to a solution. The HH we consider has a Markov model to produce sequences of low-level heuristics, which we combine with a Multi-Armed Bandit Problem (MAB)-based method to learn its parameters. This work proposes several improvements to the HH metaheuristic that yields a better learning for solving problem instances. Specifically, this is the first work in HHs to present Exponential Weights for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3) as a learning method, an algorithm that is able to deal with adversarial settings. We also present a case study for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), for which we include a list of low-level heuristics that have been proposed in the literature. We show that our algorithms can handle a large and diverse list of heuristics, illustrating that they can be easily configured to solve COPs of different nature. The computational results indicate that our algorithms are competitive methods for the VRPTW (2.16\% gap on average with respect to the best known solutions), demonstrating the potential of these algorithms to solve COPs. Finally, we show how algorithms can even detect low-level heuristics that do not contribute to finding better solutions to the problem.},

Usually, in addition to constructing a feasible timetable (all constraints satisfied), there are desirable goals like minimising the number of undesirable allocations (e.g. courses timetabled in the last timeslot of the day). The construction of course timetables is regarded as a complex problem common to a wide range of educational institutions. The great deluge algorithm explores neighbouring solutions which are accepted if they are better than the best solution so far or if the detriment in quality is no larger than the current water level. In the original great deluge, the water level decreases steadily in a linear fashion. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the great deluge algorithm in which the decay rate of the water level is non-linear. The proposed method produces new best results in 4 of the 11 course timetabling problem instances used in our experiments.},

Three heuristic algorithms are derived with a performance bound. Moreover, three lower bounds of objective are derived and tested along with the derived properties in a branch-and-bound scheme.

However, in contrast to some indications in these papers, CTV does not provide smoothness of jobs׳ completion times but is more aiming at minimizing the deviation from a common finishing date of all jobs. In this paper, a new objective function is proposed which intends to smooth the differences between the completion times of each two consecutively scheduled jobs in a permutation flow shop setting. We discuss the relevance of respective considerations, define an objective function accordingly and compare some solution approaches by means of examples and a numerical study based on the test instances from Taillard [1], [2]. A main topic of this paper is the discussion of the influence of scheduling decisions on other systems linked to this scheduling system by using our new objective function. This intends to contribute, in a specific and heuristic way, to reduce the gap between the dynamic-stochastic perspective of queuing approaches on one hand and the mostly static-deterministic perspective of job scheduling on the other.},

Any one machine can process a given set of the different product types. If it can process only one type of product it is referred to as a dedicated machine, otherwise it is referred to as a flexible machine. A flexible machine may be subject to a setup when it switches from one product type to another product type. Each product type has certain specific processing requirements on the various machines. There are n customers, each one sending in one order. An order requests specific quantities of the various different products and has a release date as well as a due date (committed shipping date). After the processing of all the different products for an order has been completed, the order can be shipped to the customer. This paper is organised as follows. We first introduce a notation for this class of models. We then focus on various different conditions on the machine environment as well as on several objective functions, including the total weighted completion time, the maximum lateness, the number of orders shipped late, and so on. We present polynomial time algorithms for the easier problems, complexity proofs for NP-hard problems and worst case performance analyses as well as empirical analyses of heuristics.},

While previous heuristic or learning-based works achieve decent solutions on small problem instances, their performance deteriorates in large problems. This article presents a novel learning-augmented local search framework to solve large-scale VRP. The method iteratively improves the solution by identifying appropriate subproblems and \$delegating\$ their improvement to a black box subsolver. At each step, we leverage spatial locality to consider only a linear number of subproblems, rather than exponential. We frame subproblem selection as regression and train a Transformer on a generated training set of problem instances. Our method accelerates state-of-the-art VRP solvers by 10x to 100x while achieving competitive solution qualities for VRPs with sizes ranging from 500 to 3000. Learned subproblem selection offers a 1.5x to 2x speedup over heuristic or random selection. Our results generalize to a variety of VRP distributions, variants, and solvers.},

The objective is to maximize the number of parcels that can be delivered during the service hours. We propose two reinforcement learning approaches for solving this problem, one based on a policy function approximation (PFA) and the second on a value function approximation (VFA). Both methods are combined with a look-ahead strategy, in which future release dates are sampled in a Monte-Carlo fashion and a tailored batch approach is used to approximate the value of future states. Our PFA and VFA make a good use of branch-and-cut-based exact methods to improve the quality of decisions. We also establish sufficient conditions for partial characterization of optimal policy and integrate them into PFA/VFA. In an empirical study based on 720 benchmark instances, we conduct a competitive analysis using upper bounds with perfect information and we show that PFA and VFA greatly outperform two alternative myopic approaches. Overall, PFA provides best solutions, while VFA (which benefits from a two-stage stochastic optimization model) achieves a better tradeoff between solution quality and computing time.},

  abstract = {Same-day deliveries (SDD) have become a new standard to satisfy the ``instant gratification'' of online customers. Despite the existing powerful technologies deployed in the last-mile delivery, SDD services face new decision making challenges related to the trade-off between delivery cost and time. In addition, new challenges related to environmental issues, customer satisfaction, or fairness of services arise. Researchers have explored various approaches to face these challenges in the context of SDD, where stochastic and dynamic data uncertainty plays a fundamental role. In this paper, we carefully review the emerging routing problems and solutions proposed in the existing literature for SDD services. We address the questions on how to deal with dynamic arrival times of orders, how to allocate time slots to deliveries, how to select the right delivery options, how to design pickup and delivery routes, or how to partition the delivery areas and design the fleet. We also formulate and compare models for representative problems elaborating on the pros and cons which might guide practitioners' model selection. Finally, we sketch challenges and identify future research directions that will further propel this exciting field of research.},

To mind the gap that most existing studies consider the routing decisions solely, this study investigates the vehicle routing problem with time windows and loading scheduling (VRPTW-LS). In this problem, the loading schedules at the loading docks and the visiting sequences for vehicles are determined to minimise the total travelled distance. To solve this problem, an adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm, embedded with a tailored solution representation and an efficient feasibility check mechanism, is developed. In addition, the results of extensive computational experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and some analyses are conducted to obtain managerial insights.},

Motivated by a large grocery chain store who offers fast on-demand delivery services, we model and solve a stochastic dynamic driver dispatching and routing problem for last-mile delivery systems where on-time performance is the main target. The system operator needs to dispatch a set of drivers and specify their delivery routes facing random demand that arrives over a fixed number of periods. The resulting stochastic dynamic program is challenging to solve due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel structured approximation framework to approximate the value function via a parametrized dispatching and routing policy. We analyze the structural properties of the approximation framework and establish its performance guarantee under large-demand scenarios. We then develop efficient exact algorithms for the approximation problem based on Benders decomposition and column generation, which deliver verifiably optimal solutions within minutes. The evaluation results on a real-world data set show that our framework outperforms the current policy of the company by 36.53\% on average in terms of delivery time. We also perform several policy experiments to understand the value of dynamic dispatching and routing with varying fleet sizes and dispatch frequencies.},

The immediate goal of automatic algorithm configuration is to find, automatically, the best parameter settings of an optimizer. Ultimately, automatic algorithm configuration has the potential to lead to new design paradigms for optimization software. The irace package is a software package that implements a number of automatic configuration procedures. In particular, it offers iterated racing procedures, which have been used successfully to automatically configure various state-of-the-art algorithms. The iterated racing procedures implemented in irace include the iterated F-race algorithm and several extensions and improvements over it. In this paper, we describe the rationale underlying the iterated racing procedures and introduce a number of recent extensions. Among these, we introduce a restart mechanism to avoid premature convergence, the use of truncated sampling distributions to handle correctly parameter bounds, and an elitist racing procedure for ensuring that the best configurations returned are also those evaluated in the highest number of training instances. We experimentally evaluate the most recent version of irace and demonstrate with a number of example applications the use and potential of irace, in particular, and automatic algorithm configuration, in general.},

The generation of problem-specific knowledge for heuristics'' (Arnold and S\"orensen, 2019) by Florian Arnold and Kenneth S\"orensen. In the original contribution, the authors implemented several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in order to predict good vs. not good solutions. Then, some outcomes of the algorithms were discussed in terms of the predictive power of the solutions features. The purpose was then to use the extracted knowledge to improve existing heuristics. The first contribution of our comment is to validate and complement some of the conclusions of the authors. Then, we argue than most of the extracted knowledge can be retrieved by classical data reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Hence, instead of ML-based predictions, a factorial analysis provides a powerful and synthetic view of the variables inter-dependencies in the light of solution quality. Thanks to the datasets provided by the authors in the original article, new experimental results are conducted. Finally, the integration of these results into future ``boosted'' heuristics is discussed.},

The solution method, called AILS-PR, outperformed existing meta-heuristics for the CVRP on benchmark instances. However, tests on large-scale instances of the CVRP suggested that PR was too slow, making AILS-PR less advantageous in this case. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents an Adaptive Iterated Local Search (AILS) with two phases in its search process. Both phases include the perturbation and local search steps of ILS. The main difference between them is that the reference solution in the first phase is found by the acceptance criterion, while in the second phase it is selected from a pool of the best solutions found in the search process, the so-called elite set. This algorithm, called AILS-II, is very competitive on smaller instances, outperforming the other methods from the literature with respect to the average gap to the best known solutions. Moreover, AILS-II consistently outperformed the state of the art on larger instances with up to 30,000 vertices.},

This book guides the reader through the nuts and bolts of the major experimental questions: What should I measure? What inputs should I test? How do I analyze the data? To answer these questions the book draws on ideas from algorithm design and analysis, computer systems, and statistics and data analysis. The wide-ranging discussion includes a tutorial on system clocks and CPU timers, a survey of strategies for tuning algorithms and data structures, a cookbook of methods for generating random combinatorial inputs, and a demonstration of variance reduction techniques.

Job processing times are assumed to be stochastic, but in contrast to traditional stochastic scheduling models, we assume that jobs arrive online, and there is no knowledge about the jobs that will arrive in the future. The model incorporates both stochastic scheduling and online scheduling as a special case. The particular setting we consider is nonpreemptive parallel machine scheduling, with the objective to minimize the total weighted completion times of jobs. We analyze simple, combinatorial online scheduling policies for that model, and derive performance guarantees that match performance guarantees previously known for stochastic and online parallel machine scheduling, respectively. For processing times that follow new better than used in expectation (NBUE) distributions, we improve upon previously best-known performance bounds from stochastic scheduling, even though we consider a more general setting.},

The objective is to minimize the makespan among factories. To address this problem, we first present a mixed integer linear model. Next, we develop five constructive heuristics to find high-quality solutions in a timely manner. Moreover, we propose an enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm (NEABC). In the NEABC, an initialization method with strong intensification is proposed to generate promising swarm. Then, a collaboration mechanism among individuals is presented in the onlooker bee stage to improve the search capability. Besides, a restart strategy is designed in the scout bee stage with the consideration of the special onlooker bee stage of the algorithm. Comprehensive experiments based on instances with a wide range of scales are carried out and the results prove the validity of presented algorithms for the problem under study.},

During daily operations, we consider the case in which customers can place requests such that their demand and location are stochastic variables. The time windows at customer locations can be violated although lateness costs are incurred. The objective is to define a set of vehicle routes which are dynamically updated to accommodate new customers in order to maximize the expected profit. This is the difference between the total revenue and the sum of lateness costs and costs associated with the total distance traveled. The solution approach makes use of a new constructive heuristic that scatters vehicles in the service area and an adaptive granular local search procedure. The strategies of letting a vehicle wait, positioning a vehicle in a region where customers are likely to appear, and diverting a vehicle away from its current destination are integrated within a granular local search heuristic. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed in test problems based on real-life Brazilian transportation companies.},

  abstract = {Split delivery routing problems are concerned with serving the demand of a set of customers with a fleet of capacitated vehicles at minimum cost, where a customer can be served by more than one vehicle if beneficial. They generalize traditional variants of routing problems and have applications in commercial and humanitarian logistics. Previously, formulations involving only commonly used arc-based variables have provided only relaxations for split delivery variants, as the possibility of visiting customers more than once introduces modeling challenges. The only known compact formulations are based on variables indexed by vehicle or by visit number and perform poorly when using general-purpose integer programming software. We present compact formulations that avoid the use of these types of variables and that can model split delivery routing problems with and without time windows. Computational experiments demonstrate their superior performance over existing compact formulations. We also develop a branch-and-cut algorithm that balances the efficiency derived from a relaxed formulation with the strength derived from one of the proposed formulations and demonstrate its efficacy on a large set of benchmark instances. The algorithm solves 95 instances to proven optimality for the first time and improves the best known lower and/or upper bound for many other instances.},

  abstract = {Constraint programming (CP) has been recently in the spotlight after new CP-based procedures have been incorporated into state-of-the-art solvers, most notably the CP Optimizer from IBM. Classical CP solvers were only capable of guaranteeing the optimality of a solution, but they could not provide bounds for the integer feasible solutions found if interrupted prematurely due to, say, time limits. New versions, however, provide bounds and optimality guarantees, effectively making CP a viable alternative to more traditional mixed-integer programming (MIP) models and solvers. We capitalize on these developments and conduct a computational evaluation of MIP and CP models on 12 select scheduling problems.1 We carefully chose these 12 problems to represent a wide variety of scheduling problems that occur in different service and manufacturing settings. We also consider basic and well-studied simplified problems. These scheduling settings range from pure sequencing (e.g., flow shop and open shop) or joint assignment-sequencing (e.g., distributed flow shop and hybrid flow shop) to pure assignment (i.e., parallel machine) scheduling problems. We present MIP and CP models for each variant of these problems and evaluate their performance over 17 relevant and standard benchmarks that we identified in the literature. The computational campaign encompasses almost 6,623 experiments and evaluates the MIP and CP models along five dimensions of problem characteristics, objective function, decision variables, input parameters, and quality of bounds. We establish the areas in which each one of these models performs well and recognize their conceivable reasons. The obtained results indicate that CP sets new limits concerning the maximum problem size that can be solved using off-the-shelf exact techniques.

In permutation flowshops the sequence of jobs is the same on all machines. A significant research effort has been devoted for sequencing jobs in a flowshop minimizing the makespan. This paper describes the application of a Constructive Genetic Algorithm (CGA) to makespan minimization on flowshop scheduling. The CGA was proposed recently as an alternative to traditional GA approaches, particularly, for evaluating schemata directly. The population initially formed only by schemata, evolves controlled by recombination to a population of well-adapted structures (schemata instantiation). The CGA implemented is based on the NEH classic heuristic and a local search heuristic used to define the fitness functions. The parameters of the CGA are calibrated using a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach. The computational results are compared against some other successful algorithms from the literature on Taillard's well-known standard benchmark. The computational experience shows that this innovative CGA approach provides competitive results for flowshop scheduling problems.},

  abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been applied on a variety of complex combinatorial optimization problems with high success. However, in relation to other classes of combinatorial problems, there is little reported experimental work for the application of GAs on large scheduling problems. The performance of a GA depends very much on the selection of the proper genetic operators. Crossover and mutation are the two major variation operators in any GA. This paper investigates the impact of various genetic operators on the genetic search through computational experiments carried out on the flow-shop scheduling problem (FSSP). A set of five crossover and six mutation operators are included in the experiments and their effectiveness on the overall performance of the GA process is measured, compared, and discussed. Furthermore, the case of crossover combination is examined under the FSSP framework investigating whether or not the various combinations outperform the sole usage of the best type of crossover operator.},

  abstract = {Same-Day Delivery services are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. These have been usually modelled by previous studies as a certain class of Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) where goods must be delivered from a depot to a set of customers in the same day that the orders were placed. Adaptive exact solution methods for DVRPs can become intractable even for small problem instances. In this paper, we formulate the SDDP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it using a parameter-sharing Deep Q-Network, which corresponds to a decentralised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. For this, we create a multi-agent grid-based SDD environment, consisting of multiple vehicles, a central depot and dynamic order generation. In addition, we introduce zone-specific order generation and reward probabilities. We compare the performance of our proposed MARL approach against a Mixed Inter Programming (MIP) solution. Results show that our proposed MARL framework performs on par with MIP-based policy when the number of orders is relatively low. For problem instances with higher order arrival rates, computational results show that the MARL approach underperforms the MIP by up to 30\%. The performance gap between both methods becomes smaller when zone-specific parameters are employed. The gap is reduced from 30\% to 3\% for a 5x5 grid scenario with 30 orders. Execution time results indicate that the MARL approach is, on average, 65 times faster than the MIP-based policy, and therefore may be more advantageous for real-time control, at least for small-sized instances.},

Experiments were carried out to compare results from the differential evolution algorithm and the genetic algorithm, which has a reputation for being very powerful. The results obtained have proven satisfactory in solution quality when compared with genetic algorithm. The novel method requires few control variables, is relatively easy to implement and use, effective, and efficient, which makes it an attractive and widely applicable approach for solving practical engineering problems.

  abstract = {This article considers a continuous-time variant of the stochastic inventory routing problem. In most of the articles present in the literature related to inventory routing, customers reveal their demands at the end of each period, which is when the inventory level is calculated. In the variant of the problem at hand, the demand that each customer experiences on each period, results in a continuous decrease of the inventory for the customer during the period. This characteristic strongly affects the quantities that can be delivered to each customer and, if the deliveries are not sufficient or arrive too late, they can cause some stock-out situations within the periods. In the inventory routing problem, the vendor manages all the replenishment decisions of the vendees and, therefore, creates delivery plans for a planning horizon, aiming to reduce the routing, consistency, inventory and lost-sales costs. We formulate the problem as a two-stage mathematical program. Customers experience a continuous stochastic demand within each period and present information about inventory level and capacity at each period, as well as the time windows in which deliveries can take place. To solve this problem, we develop a matheuristic solution approach based on an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. In addition, we evaluate the impact of applying recourse actions to deal with expected lost sales during the planning horizon. We compare the performance of the algorithm with adapted variants of the multiple scenario approach and the branch and regret algorithms from the literature. Samples based on the stochastic demands are considered in the algorithms, to find robust solutions that can minimize the objective function. We evaluate the solutions by means of a sample average estimator procedure, and we compare the efficiency of the algorithms as well as the impact of different levels of stochasticity.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The competitiveness of a retailer is highly dependent on an efficient distribution system. This is especially true for the supply of stores from distribution centers. Stores ask for high flexibility when it comes to their supply. This means that fast order processing is essential. Order processing affects different subsystems at the distribution center: orders are picked in multiple picking zones, transferred to intermediate storage, and delivered via dedicated tours. These processing steps are highly interdependent. The schedule for picking needs to be synchronized with the routing decisions to ensure availability of orders at the DC's loading docks when their associated tours are scheduled. Concurrently, intermediate storage represents a bottleneck as capacity for order storage is limited. The simultaneous planning of picking and routing operations with restricted intermediate storage is therefore relevant for retail practice but has not so far been considered within an integrated planning approach. Our work addresses this task and discusses an integrated zone picking and vehicle routing problem with restricted intermediate storage. We present a comprehensive model formulation and introduce a general variable neighborhood search for simultaneous consideration of the given planning stages. We also present two alternative sequential approaches that are motivated by the prevailing planning situation in industry. Numerical experiments and a case study show the need for an integrated planning approach to obtain practicable results. Further, we identify the impact of the main problem characteristics on overall planning and provide valuable insights for the application of these findings in industry.},

  abstract = {The no-idle permutation flowshop scheduling problem (NIPFSP) extends the well-known permutation flowshop scheduling problem, where idle time is not allowed on the machines. This study proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a new constraint programming (CP) model for the NIPFSP with makespan criterion. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents a CP model for the NIPFSP for the first time in the literature. We also compare the performance of the proposed MILP and CP models with a well-known MILP model from the literature. Since the studied problem is NP-hard, we also develop a new iterated greedy algorithm with restart and learning mechanisms (IG\_RL) and a new iterated local search with restart and learning mechanisms (ILS\_RL) as metaheuristics for the problem. In the proposed algorithms, all the parameters are determined by a learning mechanism in a self-adaptive way. Furthermore, a restart mechanism is employed in the proposed IG\_RL and ILS\_RL algorithms to guarantee the variety of the initial solutions and to assist the algorithm in avoiding the local optima. A variable neighborhood descent procedure is also embedded in the proposed algorithms. We use two well-known benchmark sets, i.e., VRF and Ruiz benchmark suites, to evaluate the performance of proposed solution methods. For almost half of the 240 small VRF instances, optimal results are reported by the MILP and CP models, whereas time-limited model results are reported for the rest. The results on small instances show that the proposed MILP and CP models outperform the MILP model from literature, where the CP model performs better than both MILP models. We compare the performance of the proposed IG\_RL and ILS\_RL algorithms with the state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature on both large VRF instances and Ruiz benchmark instances. The computational results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ILS\_RL and IG\_RL algorithms for solving the NIPFSP. Primarily, this study improves the current best-known solutions for 102 out of the 250 Ruiz benchmark instances. Additionally, this study reports the NIPFSP results for the well-known VRF benchmark set for the first time in the literature.},

In this paper, we automatically generate new high-performing algorithms for some of the most widely studied variants of the PFSP. More in detail, we (i) developed a new algorithm framework, EMILI, that implements algorithm-specific and problem-specific building blocks; (ii) define the rules of how to compose algorithms from the building blocks; and (iii) employ an automatic algorithm configuration tool to search for high performing algorithm configurations. With these ingredients, we automatically generate algorithms for the PFSP with the objectives makespan, total completion time and total tardiness, which outperform the best algorithms obtained by a manual algorithm engineering process.},

However, minimizing total flowtime in DPFSP, a very relevant and meaningful objective for today's dynamic manufacturing environment, has not captured much attention so far. In this paper, we address the DPFSP with total flowtime criterion. To suit the needs of different CPU time demands and solution quality, we present three constructive heuristics and four metaheuristics. The constructive heuristics are based on the well-known LR and NEH heuristics. The metaheuristics are based on the high-performing frameworks of discrete artificial bee colony, scatter search, iterated local search, and iterated greedy, which have been applied with great success to closely related scheduling problems. We explore the problem-specific knowledge and accelerations to evaluate neighboring solutions for the considered problem. We introduce advanced and effective technologies like a referenced local search, a strategy to escape from local optima, and an enhanced intensive search method for the presented metaheuristics. A comprehensive computational campaign against the closely related and well performing algorithms in the literature is carried out. The results show that both the presented constructive heuristics and metaheuristics are very effective for solving the DPFSP with total flowtime criterion.},

  abstract = {Empirical design in reinforcement learning is no small task. Running good experiments requires attention to detail and at times significant computational resources. While compute resources available per dollar have continued to grow rapidly, so have the scale of typical experiments in reinforcement learning. It is now common to benchmark agents with millions of parameters against dozens of tasks, each using the equivalent of 30 days of experience. The scale of these experiments often conflict with the need for proper statistical evidence, especially when comparing algorithms. Recent studies have highlighted how popular algorithms are sensitive to hyper-parameter settings and implementation details, and that common empirical practice leads to weak statistical evidence (Machado et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2018). Here we take this one step further. This manuscript represents both a call to action, and a comprehensive resource for how to do good experiments in reinforcement learning. In particular, we cover: the statistical assumptions underlying common performance measures, how to properly characterize performance variation and stability, hypothesis testing, special considerations for comparing multiple agents, baseline and illustrative example construction, and how to deal with hyper-parameters and experimenter bias. Throughout we highlight common mistakes found in the literature and the statistical consequences of those in example experiments. The objective of this document is to provide answers on how we can use our unprecedented compute to do good science in reinforcement learning, as well as stay alert to potential pitfalls in our empirical design.},

  abstract = {This work considers a scheduling problem identified in a factory producing customised Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment. More specifically, the metal folding section is modelled as unrelated parallel machines with machine eligibility and sequence-dependent setup times. The objective under consideration is the minimisation of the total tardiness. The problem is known to be NP-hard so approximate methods are needed to solve real-size instances. In order to embed the scheduling procedure into a decision support system providing high-quality solutions in nearly real time, the goal of this paper is to develop fast, efficient constructive heuristics for the problem. Due to the lack of methods for this specific problem, some existing heuristics and one metaheuristic are selected from related problems and adapted. In addition, a set of heuristics with novel repair and improvement phases are proposed. The performance of the methods adapted and the proposals are compared with the optimal/approximate solutions obtained by a solver for an MILP in two sets of instances with small and medium sizes. Additionally, big-size instances (representing more realistic cases for our company) have been solved using the proposed constructive heuristics, providing efficient solutions in negligible computational times. Even if the adaptation of heuristics performs reasonably well, these are outperformed by the new heuristic proposed in this paper. In addition, when the new heuristic is embedded in the metaheuristic adapted from a related the problem, the results obtained are excellent in terms of the quality of the solution, even if the computational effort is somewhat higher.},

Possibly as a side effect of this steady growth, the state-of-the-art on many decision problems within the field is far from being clear, with substantial overlaps in the solution procedures, lack of (fair) comparisons against existing methods, or the use of different denominations for the same problem, among other issues. In this paper, we carry out a review of the DPFS literature aimed at providing a classification and notation for DPFS problems under a common framework. Within this framework, contributions are exhaustively presented and discussed, together with the state-of-the-art of the problems and lines for future research.},

For this NP-hard problem we develop a novel efficient approximate solution procedure. More specifically, we develop an innovative discrete differential evolution algorithm where differential mutations are performed directly in the permutation space and that uses a novel, parameter-free, restart procedure. The so-obtained solutions are improved by two proposed local search mechanisms that employ problem-specific, heuristic dominance relations. We carry out an extensive computational experience with randomly generated test instances to compare our proposal with existing algorithms from related problems. In these experiments, the proposed algorithm obtains the best results in terms of their average relative percentage deviation and success rate. Furthermore, an analysis of variance test, followed by a Tukey's test, confirms the excellent performance of the algorithm proposed.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of scheduling jobs in a flowshop layout where the machines can operate at different speeds and require an amount of a resource that is a non-decreasing function of its speed. Furthermore, there is a limit in the maximum amount of the resource that can be consumed, so the problem serves to model either a constraint on the energy or raw material employed in the process, or on the maximum amount of pollutant that can be emitted. In contrast to the classical permutation flowshop scheduling problem, in the variant under study the processing times are controllable, there is an specific resource consumption, and each job has a due date. The objective function considered is the minimization of the total tardiness of the jobs. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we focus onto developing approximate solution procedures that can yield high-quality solutions with a reasonable CPU effort. More specifically, we develop a fast solution procedure to build an initial solution and two hybrid matheuristics based on mixed-integer linear programming formulations of the problem. The first one combines a relax-and-fix approach with the generation of heuristic cutting planes, while the second one relaxes some decision variables in the first stage and fixes other decision variables in the final stage. The computational experience carried out show that our proposals outperform the mathematical models as well as an approximate procedure proposed for a related problem.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we summarize research efforts on several different problems that fall under the rubric of online scheduling. In online scheduling, the scheduler receives jobs that arrive over time, and generally must schedule the jobs without any knowledge of the future. The lack of knowledge of the future generally precludes the scheduler from guaranteeing optimal schedules. Thus much research has been focused on finding scheduling algorithms that guarantee schedules that are in some way not too far from optimal. We focus on problems that arise within the ubiquitous client-server setting. In a client-server system, there are many clients and one server (or a perhaps a few servers). Clients submit requests for service to the server(s) over time. In the language of scheduling, a server is a processor, and a request is a job. Applications that motivate the research we survey include multiuser operating systems such as Unix and Windows, web servers, database servers, name servers, and load...},

  abstract = {Since the late 70s, much research activity has taken place on the class of dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRP), with the time period after year 2000 witnessing a real explosion in related papers. Our paper sheds more light into work in this area over more than 3 decades by developing a taxonomy of DVRP papers according to 11 criteria. These are (1) type of problem, (2) logistical context, (3) transportation mode, (4) objective function, (5) fleet size, (6) time constraints, (7) vehicle capacity constraints, (8) the ability to reject customers, (9) the nature of the dynamic element, (10) the nature of the stochasticity (if any), and (11) the solution method. We comment on technological vis-\`a-vis methodological advances for this class of problems and suggest directions for further research. The latter include alternative objective functions, vehicle speed as decision variable, more explicit linkages of methodology to technological advances and analysis of worst case or average case performance of heuristics. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Motivated by traditional Chinese medicine decoction and delivery problems in our collaborative Chinese medicine decoction company, this study addresses integrated production scheduling and vehicle routing decisions. To deal with this problem, we first propose a mixed integer linear programming model considering hybrid flow shop production and multi-trip multi-vehicle delivery, which is challenging to solve for medium- and large-size instances. We then propose an improved memetic algorithm (MA) that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) with education operators, including local search procedures. To improve the performance of the MA, we consider the contribution of diversity in the fitness function to enhance the exploratory ability, propose a parent selection operator by considering the softmax function to balance exploitation and exploration, and design three customized crossover operators and five education operators with local search procedures. Numerical experiments show that the integrated scheduling method shortens the total makespan by 11.19\% compared with separated production scheduling and vehicle routing methods. We compare the proposed MA with Gurobi for small-size instances, and with the GA for special cases (single-stage production) for medium- or large-size instances. The results of numerical experiments for 360 instances show that the MA can find solutions with a gap of no more than 2\% from the optimal solution within 3~s for small-size instances, and can improve the solutions of the GA and the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm by more than 30\% and 10\%.},

  abstract = {Optimization techniques known as metaheuristics have been applied successfully to solve different problems, in which their development is characterized by the appropriate selection of parameters (values) for its execution. Where the adjustment of a parameter is required, this parameter will be tested until viable results are obtained. Normally, such adjustments are made by the developer deploying the metaheuristic. The quality of the results of a test instance [The term instance is used to refer to the assignment of values to the input variables of a problem.] will not be transferred to the instances that were not tested yet and its feedback may require a slow process of ``trial and error'' where the algorithm has to be adjusted for a specific application. Within this context of metaheuristics the Reactive Search emerged defending the integration of machine learning within heuristic searches for solving complex optimization problems. Based in the integration that the Reactive Search proposes between machine learning and metaheuristics, emerged the idea of putting Reinforcement Learning, more specifically the Q-learning algorithm with a reactive behavior, to select which local search is the most appropriate in a given time of a search, to succeed another local search that can not improve the current solution in the VNS metaheuristic. In this work we propose a reactive implementation using Reinforcement Learning for the self-tuning of the implemented algorithm, applied to the Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem.},

These initiatives, which have become more prevalent in recent years, face high levels of uncertainty in their supply chain. Inspired by challenges facing the food banks in The Netherlands, this paper describes an optimization model that can assist food bank supply chains with the distribution of an available investment budget in order to increase the number of beneficiaries that can receive food assistance. Strategic investments can be used to tackle shortages in transport, storage, and food donations. The optimization model prioritizes investments that will have the largest positive social impact, which we define as the number of beneficiaries that can be served by the food banks. Furthermore, the model deals with real-world circumstances, such as decentralized organizations, data scarcity, location-specific transport and storage capacities, and strong diversity in food bank operations. The model is applied using real-life data from the food bank supply chain in The Netherlands and the results establish investments that increase capacity and will serve 32\% more beneficiaries. The association of Dutch food banks has made practical application of these findings.},

Thus, each order has a release date (when the order can be dispatched from the depot) and a service guarantee that implies a deadline (when the order needs to be delivered). A vehicle delivering an order cannot depart the depot before~the~order is released, and must arrive at the customer at or before the order's deadline. We show that single and multiple vehicle variants where customers are located on a half-line can be solved to optimality in polynomial time.

Here we address this issue in the context of a dynamic and stochastic patient transportation problem, where besides considering new events, we also incorporate stochastic information about future events. We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality benefits from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We find that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.},

An additional feature of the problem is that each job falls into one of {$\rho$} priority classes. The objective is to maximize the number of jobs scheduled, where a job in a higher priority class has infinitely more value than a job in a lower priority class. The GRASP consists of two phases. The first phase produces feasible solutions by ranking each job with a greedy function and then selecting one at random from a restricted candidate list. The process is repeated until no more jobs can be scheduled. The second phase seeks a local optimum by searching over a series of neighborhoods defined by job insertions and exchanges. The algorithm is compared to a dynamic-programming heuristic that sequentially schedules the jobs in each priority class. Extensive computational results are presented based on data drawn from an application involving the use of communications relay satellites.},

  abstract = {The Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls is a generalization of the ordinary capacitated vehicle routing problem where goods are delivered from the depot to the linehaul customers, and additional goods are brought back to the depot from the backhaul customers. Numerous ways of modeling the backhaul constraints have been proposed in the literature, each imposing different restrictions on the handling of backhaul customers. A survey of these models is presented, and a unified model is developed that is capable of handling most variants of the problem from the literature. The unified model can be seen as a Rich Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows, which can be solved through an improved version of the large neighborhood search heuristic proposed by Ropke and Pisinger [An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, Technical Report, DIKU, University of Copenhagen, 2004]. The results obtained in this way are comparable to or improve on similar results found by state of the art heuristics for the various variants of the problem. The heuristic has been tested on 338 problems from the literature and it has improved the best known solution for 227 of these. An additional benefit of the unified modeling and solution method is that it allows the dispatcher to mix various variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls for the individual customers or vehicles.},

  abstract = {The pickup and delivery problem with time windows is the problem of serving a number of transportation requests using a limited amount of vehicles. Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints. This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search. The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50\% of the problems. The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics.},

Some authors have concluded that genetic algorithms are not suitable for this hard, combinatorial problem unless hybridization is used. This work proposes new genetic algorithms for solving the permutation FSP that prove to be competitive when compared to many other well known algorithms. The optimization criterion considered is the minimization of the total completion time or makespan (Cmax). We show a robust genetic algorithm and a fast hybrid implementation. These algorithms use new genetic operators, advanced techniques like hybridization with local search and an efficient population initialization as well as a new generational scheme. A complete evaluation of the different parameters and operators of the algorithms by means of a Design of Experiments approach is also given. The algorithm's effectiveness is compared against 11 other methods, including genetic algorithms, tabu search, simulated annealing and other advanced and recent techniques. For the evaluations we use Taillard's well known standard benchmark. The results show that the proposed algorithms are very effective and at the same time are easy to implement.},

The first IG algorithm is a straightforward adaption of the IG principle, while the second incorporates a simple descent local search. Furthermore, we consider two different optimization objectives, the minimization of the maximum completion time or makespan and the minimization of the total weighted tardiness. Extensive experiments and statistical analyses demonstrate that, despite their simplicity, the IG algorithms are new state-of-the-art methods for both objectives.},

This gave rise to the field of contextual optimization, under which data-driven procedures are developed to prescribe actions to the decision-maker that make the best use of the most recently updated information. A large variety of models and methods have been presented in both OR and ML literature under a variety of names, including data-driven optimization, prescriptive optimization, predictive stochastic programming, policy optimization, (smart) predict/estimate-then-optimize, decision-focused learning, (task-based) end-to-end learning/forecasting/optimization, etc. Focusing on single and two-stage stochastic programming problems, this review article identifies three main frameworks for learning policies from data and discusses their strengths and limitations. We present the existing models and methods under a uniform notation and terminology and classify them according to the three main frameworks identified. Our objective with this survey is to both strengthen the general understanding of this active field of research and stimulate further theoretical and algorithmic advancements in integrating ML and stochastic programming.},

Customer satisfaction can be strongly increased by offering narrow delivery time windows. However, there is a tradeoff for the logistics provider because user-friendly delivery time windows might decrease operational flexibility. Against this background, we study the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (VRPMTW) that determines a set of optimal routes such that each customer is visited once within one out of several time windows. We present a large neighborhood search\textendash based metaheuristic for the VRPMTW that contains a dynamic programming component to optimally select a time window for each customer on a route, and we present computationally efficient move descriptors for all search operators. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the Belhaiza instance set for the objectives of minimizing traveled distance and duration. For the former objective, we provide new best-known solutions for 9 of 48 instances, and for the latter, we provide new best-known solutions for 13 of 48 instances. Overall, our algorithm provides the best average solution quality over the full benchmark set among all available algorithms. Furthermore, we design new benchmark instances that reflect planning tasks in user-centered last-mile logistics. Based on these, we present managerial studies that show the benefit of our algorithm for practitioners and allow to derive insights on how to offer time windows to customers. We show that offering multiple time windows can be economically beneficial for the logistics service providers and increases customer flexibility simultaneously.},

In extensive numerical experiments with a granular tabu search (GTS) for the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), we find that sparsification methods using reduced-cost values based on the solution of a linear relaxation of the original problem outperform standard sparsification methods. Furthermore, including additional depot arcs into the restricted arc set (beyond those selected by the sparsification method) improves solution quality. The same is true for dynamically inserting into the restricted arc set (i)~the arcs involved in the best move selected in each iteration, and (ii)~the arcs of the current best-known solution. Moreover, for small restricted arc sets, guaranteeing a minimum number of incoming and outgoing arcs per vertex is beneficial. Finally, dynamically altering the size of the restricted arc set can be used to successfully diversify and intensify the search, which has a significant positive effect on solution quality. The usefulness of the gained insights about the design of granular solution methods is demonstrated by the performance of the final configuration of our GTS for VRPTW, which obtains state-of-the-art results and reaches an outstanding computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Local delivery platforms are collaborative undertakings where local stores offer instant-delivery to local customers ordering their products online. Offering such delivery services both cost-efficiently and reliably is one of the main challenges for local delivery platforms, as they face a complex, dynamic, stochastic dynamic pickup-and-delivery problem. Orders need to be consolidated to increase the efficiency of the delivery operations and thereby enable a high service guarantee towards the customer and stores. But, waiting for consolidation opportunities may jeopardize delivery service reliability in the future, and thus requires anticipating future demand. This paper introduces a generic approach to balance the consolidation potential and delivery urgency of orders. Specifically, it presents a newly developed parameterized Cost-Function Approximation (CFA) approach that modifies a set-packing formulation with two parameters. This CFA approach not only anticipates future demand but also utilizes column generation to search the large decision space related to pickup-and-delivery problems fast. Inspired by a motivating application in the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, numerical experiments show that our CFA approach strongly increases perceived customer satisfaction while lowering the total travel time of the vehicles compared to various benchmark policies. Furthermore, our CFA also reduces the percentage of late deliveries, and their lateness, to a minimum. Finally, our approach may assist managers in practice to manage the non-trivial balance between consolidation opportunity and delivery urgency.},

  abstract = {Supermarkets typically order their goods from a centrally located distribution center~(warehouse). Each order that the warehouse receives is characterized by the requested items, the location of the respective supermarket and a due date by which the items have to be delivered. For processing an order, a human operator~(order picker) retrieves the requested items from their storage locations in the warehouse first. The items are then available for shipment and loaded on the vehicle which performs the tour including the respective location of the supermarket. Whether and to which extent a due date is violated (tardiness) depends on the composition of the tours, the corresponding routes and the start dates of the tours~(vehicle routing subproblem). The start date of a tour, however, is also affected by the assignment of orders to pickers and the sequence according to which the orders are processed by the pickers (order picking subproblem). Although both subproblems are closely interconnected, they have not been considered simultaneously in the literature so far. In this paper, an iterated local search algorithm is designed for the simultaneous solution of the subproblems. By means of extensive numerical experiments, it is shown that the proposed approach is able to generate high-quality solutions even for large instances. Furthermore, the economic benefits of an integrated solution are investigated. Problem classes are identified, where the sequential solution of the subproblems leads to acceptable results, and it is pointed out in which cases an integrated solution is inevitable.},

Retailers, however, are investigating whether same-day deliveries can be offered to online and store customers in order to meet increasing customer requirements. The present paper considers an integrated order picking and vehicle routing problem assuming same-day delivery in the field of omnichannel retailing. Within this context the paper focuses on the picking and delivery process for large durable consumer goods, for example, consumer electronics and home appliances with the option of associated installation services at the customer's home as well as store deliveries for click-and-collect customers and the short-term replenishment of store inventory. We develop a decision support model and a general variable neighborhood search-based algorithm that tackle the problem described by considering the tradeoff between picking and delivery costs while ensuring customers' delivery time windows. The results show the benefits of an integrated solution approach amounting to approx. 13\% total cost savings on average, compared to a sequential approach typically applied in retail practice. A case study from an internationally operating omnichannel retailer demonstrates the advantages and applicability of the modeling and solution approach suggested.},

This paper studies a distributed no-wait flexible flow shop scheduling problem (DNWFFSP) with the makespan criterion, where each factory includes an identical flexible flow shop with no-wait constraint that requires each job to be processed without any waiting time between consecutive stages. A mixed-integer linear programming model for the DNWFFSP is presented. A machine selection method based on the first earliest available machine rule is presented. Three greedy factory assignment rules incorporating NEH (Nawaz-Enscore-Ham) heuristic are developed to allocate jobs into factories. Fourteen dispatch rules involving simple sorting and decomposition method are developed to construct a priority sequence of jobs. Thus, several constructive heuristics are obtained by combining dispatch rules and factory assignment rules. Furthermore, a constructive heuristic version of variable neighborhood descend is designed to address the DNWFFSP. One of constructive heuristics is selected to generate an initial solution, and five neighborhood search methods are used as the local search procedure. A comprehensive numerical comparison and statistical analysis are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed approaches. The distributed NEH2 with smallest largest-medium rule obtains better results than other constructive heuristics for large-size instances.},

This paper studies the dynamic order dispatching problem in an autonomous last-mile delivery system with intrinsic demand uncertainty. We consider a rolling order-fulfilment context and formulate a two-stage stochastic programming to take into account both existing unfulfilled orders and future incoming requests to minimize the total expected delays in package delivery. The considered uncertainty includes the stochastic arrival of delivery requests, their types, locations/delivery distances, and associated penalties for late delivery. Due to the constrained service capacity, the size of the problem grows exponentially as the number of simulated scenarios increases. In this study, we propose a modified integer L-shaped method, which (i) significantly reduces the number of nodes in the branching tree, and (ii) simplifies the computation of optimality cuts. The computational results show that these two modifications improve the average running time by roughly 10 times and 1,000 times compared to the non-customized L-shaped method and the classic branch-and-bound method, respectively. The linearly growing computational speed in response to the number of scenarios enables it as a viable solution for large-sized problems in reality.},

  abstract = {The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) has been subject to intense research efforts for more than sixty years. Yet, significant algorithmic improvements are still being made. The most competitive heuristic solution algorithms of today utilize, and often combine, strategies and elements from evolutionary algorithms, local search, and ruin-and-recreate based large neighborhood search. In this paper we propose a new hybrid metaheuristic for the CVRP, where the education phase of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) algorithm proposed by (Vidal Hybrid Genetic Search for the CVRP: Open-Source Implementation and SWAP* Neighborhood 2020) is extended by applying large neighborhood search (LNS). By performing a series of computational experiments, we attempt to answer the following research questions: 1) Is it possible to gain performance by adding LNS as a component in the education phase of HGS? 2) How does the addition of LNS change the relative importance of the local search neighborhoods of HGS? 3) What is the effect of devoting computational efforts to the creation of an elite solution in the initial population of HGS? Through a set of computational experiments we answer these research questions, while at the same time obtaining a good configuration of global parameter settings for the proposed heuristic. Testing the heuristic on benchmark instances from the literature with limited computing time, it outperforms existing algorithms, both in terms of the final gap and the primal integral.},

  abstract = {Online and omnichannel retailers are proposing increasingly tight delivery deadlines, moving toward instant on-demand delivery. To operate last-mile distribution systems with such tight delivery deadlines efficiently, defining the right strategic distribution network design is of paramount importance. However, this problem exceeds the complexity of the strategic design of traditional last-mile distribution networks for two main reasons: (1) the reduced time available for order handling and delivery and (2) the absence of a delivery cut-off time that clearly separates order collection and delivery periods. This renders state-of-the-art last-mile distribution network design models inappropriate, as they assume periodic order fulfillment based on a delivery cutoff. In this study, we propose a metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) approach to strategically design last-mile distribution networks with tight delivery deadlines. Our methodology integrates an in-depth simulator with traditional optimization techniques by extending a traditional black-box SO algorithm with an analytical model that captures the underlying structure of the decision problem. Based on a numerical study inspired by the efforts of a global fashion company to introduce on-demand distribution with tight delivery deadlines in Manhattan, we show that our approach outperforms contemporary SO approaches as well as deterministic and stochastic programming methods. In particular, our method systematically yields network designs with superior expected cost performance. Furthermore, it converges to good solutions with a lower computational budget and is more consistent in finding high-quality solutions. We show how congestion effects in the processing of orders at facilities negatively impact the network performance through late delivery of orders and reduced potential for consolidation. In addition, we show that the sensitivity of the optimal network design to congestion effects in order processing at the facilities increases as delivery deadlines become increasingly tight.},

The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together \textendash{} it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics.},

Traditionally these schedules establish basic concepts within the job shop scheduling literature. There they are usually defined in a rather informal way which does not create any substantial problems. Using these concepts in the more general RCPSP without giving a formal definition may cause serious problems. After providing a formal definition of semi-active, active, and non-delay schedules for the RCPSP we outline some of these problems occurring within the disjunctive arc concept.},

We experimentally investigate the effect of specific implementation choices in our ILS algorithm and analyze its performance.

  abstract = {Iterated greedy is a search method that iterates through applications of construction heuristics using the repeated execution of two main phases, the partial destruction of a complete candidate solution and a subsequent re-construction of a complete candidate solution. Iterated greedy is based on a simple principle and methods based on this principle have been proposed and published several times in the literature under different names such as simu- lated annealing, iterative flattening, ruin-and-recreate, large neighborhood search and others. Despite its simplicity, iterated greedy has led to rather high-performing algorithms. In combination with other heuristic optimiza- tion techniques such as a local search, it has given place to state-of-the-art algorithms for various problems. This paper reviews the main principles of iterated greedy algorithms, relates the basic technique to the various propos- als based on this principle, discusses its relationship with other optimization techniques, and gives an overview of problems to which iterated greedy has been successfully applied.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a framework that unifies and generalizes well-known literature results related to local search for the job-shop and flexible job-shop scheduling problems. In addition to the choice of the metaheuristic and the neighborhood structure, the success of most of the influential local search approaches relies on the ability to quickly and efficiently rule out infeasible moves and evaluate the quality of the feasible neighbors. Hence, the proposed framework focuses on the feasibility and quality evaluation of a general move when solving the job-shop and flexible job-shop scheduling problems for any regular objective function. The proposed framework is valid for any scheduling problem where the defined neighborhood structure is appropriate, and each solution to the problem can be modeled with a directed acyclic graph with non-negative weights on nodes and arcs. The feasibility conditions and quality estimation procedures proposed in the literature rely heavily on information on the existence of a path between two nodes. Thus, based on an original parameterized algorithm that asserts the existence of a path between two nodes, novel generic procedures to evaluate the feasibility of a move and estimate the value of any regular objective function of a neighbor solution are proposed. We show that many well-known literature results are special cases of our results, which can be applied to a wide range of shop scheduling problems.},

The method uses an effective intensification/diversification tool that can be successfully applied to a wide class of graph-theoretic and combinatorial-optimization problems. Granular tabu search is based on the use of drastically restricted neighborhoods, not containing the moves that involve only elements that are not likely to belong to good feasible solutions. These restricted neighborhoods are called granular, and may be seen as an efficient implementation of candidate-list strategies proposed for tabu-search algorithms. Results of computational testing of the proposed approach on the well-known symmetric capacitated and distance-constrained vehicle-routing problem are discussed, showing that the approach is able to determine very good solutions within short computing times.},

Specifically, given a set of customers within a service region that an operator needs to serve, we seek to find the operator's route and time schedule. The quality of routing and scheduling decisions is a function of the total operational cost, consisting of customers' waiting time, and the operator's travel time, idle time and overtime. We propose and rigorously analyze a stochastic programming model and two distributionally robust optimization (DRO) models to solve the problem, assuming known and unknown service and travel time distributions, respectively. We consider two popular types of ambiguity sets for the DRO models: mean-support and 1-Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We derive equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulations of both DRO models that can be implemented and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software, thereby enabling practitioners to use these models. In an extensive numerical experiment, we investigate the proposed models' computational and operational performance and derive insights into the problem.},

  abstract = {In many real-world situations it is necessary to make timely scheduling decisions. In most cases, metaheuristic algorithms are used to solve various scheduling problems because of their flexibility and their ability to produce satisfactory results in a short time. In recent years, several novel or hybrid metaheuristics have been proposed for scheduling problems. Although such research leads to new insights, it inevitably causes certain problems. First, it becomes unclear which methods perform best, especially if they are not properly compared with existing ones. Second, the proposed methods become increasingly complex, making them more difficult to understand and apply. The goal of this study is to investigate the possibility of defining efficient but simple iterative local search (ILS) methods for the parallel unrelated machines environment with minimisation of the total weighted tardiness. To improve the efficiency of ILS methods, several design decisions, such as the construction of the initial solution and choice of local search operators. The proposed methods have been compared with several metaheuristics, of which they achieve significantly better results. Thus, we conclude that it is not necessary to increase the complexity of metaheuristics to achieve better results. Rather, better results can be obtained with simple but well-designed local search methods.},

In some cases, not all customers are known at the time of the decision, but may request service in the course of day. Here, anticipation of possible future requests in current decision making is mandatory to avoid ineffective decisions and to serve a high amount of requests within the service period. In this paper, we present a vehicle routing problem with stochastic customer requests. The objective is to maximize the number of served requests regarding a time limit. Decision points occur dynamically by arriving at a customer. To achieve anticipatory decisions, we define a rollout algorithm (RA) combined with sampling of future requests. Over a limited decision horizon, RA maximizes the immediate reward and the expected rewards-to-go explicitly considering every customer. Later rewards-to-go are estimated by sampling using a cheapest insertion greedy decision policy. We compare the RA with a value function approximation (VFA) benchmark heuristic. VFA allows long-term anticipation on the expense of only implicit customer consideration using key parameters. For instances, where explicit customer consideration is necessary, RA achieves a significantly higher solution quality than VFA.},

  abstract = {In practical applications like parcel or technician services, customers request service during the day. Service providers decide whether to accept a customer for same-day service or to defer a customer due to resource limitations. Some requests are therefore postponed to the following day. To satisfy customer expectations, service providers aim on a high number of same-day services. Still, acceptance decisions not only affect the performance on the current, but also on the following day. Suitable acceptance, postponement, and routing decisions therefore should anticipate future routing and requests in both the current and the next day(s). The resulting decision problem is a dynamic multi-period vehicle routing problem with stochastic service requests. To approximately solve the Markov decision process of the presented problem, we present an anticipatory dynamic policy based on approximate dynamic programming. This policy estimates the potential of problem states with respect to future same-period services within and over the periods. Our policy draws on value function approximation, state space aggregation, and on a classification of the periods. We compare our policy to several policies from the literature. We analyze how and when multi-period anticipation improves the solution quality significantly and how the newly developed state space classification is essential to achieve anticipation. We finally show how multi-period anticipation changes the acceptance behavior to less discrimination of rural customers and to a fairer geographical distribution of same-day services in comparison to single-period anticipation.},

In the field of dynamic routing, capturing the joint evolution of complex sequential routing decisions and stochastic information is challenging, leading to a situation where rigorous methods have outpaced rigorous models and thus making it difficult for researchers to engage in rigorous science. We provide a modeling framework that strongly connects application with method and that leverages the rich body of route-based planning and optimization. As a generalization of conventional Markov decision processes (MDPs), route-based MDPs augment the state space, action space, and reward structure to include routing information. Accordingly, route-based MDPs make it conceptually easier to connect dynamic routing problems with the route-based methods typically used to solve them \textendash{} construct and revise routes as new information is learned. We anticipate route-based MDPs will facilitate more scientific rigor in dynamic routing studies, provide researchers with a common modeling language, allow for better inquiry, and improve classification and description of solution methods.},

  abstract = {Due to the current trends in business as the necessity to have a large catalogue of products, orders that increase in frequency but not in size, globalisation and a market that is increasingly competitive, the production sector faces an ever harder economical environment. All this raises the need for production scheduling with maximum efficiency and effectiveness. The first scientific publications on production scheduling appeared more than half a century ago. However, many authors have recognised a gap between the literature and the industrial problems. Most of the research concentrates on optimisation problems that are actually a very simplified version of reality. This allows for the use of sophisticated approaches and guarantees in many cases that optimal solutions are obtained. Yet, the exclusion of real-world restrictions harms the applicability of those methods. What the industry needs are systems for optimised production scheduling that adjust exactly to the conditions in the production plant and that generates good solutions in very little time. This is exactly the objective in this thesis, that is, to treat more realistic scheduling problems and to help closing the gap between the literature and practice. The considered scheduling problem is called the hybrid flowshop problem, which consists in a set of jobs that flow through a number of production stages. At each of the stages, one of the machines that belong to the stage is visited. A series of restriction is considered that include the possibility to skip stages, non-eligible machines, precedence constraints, positive and negative time lags and sequence dependent setup times. In the literature, such a large number of restrictions has not been considered simultaneously before. Briefly, in this thesis a very realistic production scheduling problem is studied. Various optimisation methods are presented for the described scheduling problem. A mixed integer programming model is proposed, in order to obtai},

The goal of this thesis is to design an algorithm that finds a good solution for the problem within 15 minutes. In the literature, the problem is usually applied to public transport cases. We consider the freight transport application of an online grocer. We introduce a Multi-Commodity Minimum Network Flow ILP implementation for MDVSPTW with short computation time. Also, based on the Concurrent Scheduler algorithm for MDVSP from the literature, we introduce the Greedy Scheduler algorithm that is able to find a feasible solution within short computation time for our problem. These two implementations form building blocks for the three main algorithms we introduce, that find good feasible solutions for our problem within 15 minutes: the ILP + Greedy algorithm, the Random Search algorithm and the Random Search and Fix algorithm. We incorporate the driver day duration restriction in the three algorithms by either allowing a driver change, that is two drivers executing one truck day, or not, and compare the results. We show that the ILP + Greedy algorithm performs the best. In the case an algorithm that does not involve an ILP is preferred, e.g., for robustness reasons, the Random Search and Fix algorithm performs better than the Random Search algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the dispatching problem faced by an urban consolidation center. The center receives orders according to a stochastic arrival process and dispatches them in batches for the last-mile distribution. The operator of the center aims to find the cost-minimizing consolidation policy, depending on the orders at hand, preannounced orders, and stochastic arrivals. We present this problem as a variant of the delivery dispatching problem that includes dispatch windows and define a corresponding Markov decision model. Larger instances of the problem suffer from intractably large state-, outcome-, and action spaces. We propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that can handle such instances, using a linear value function approximation to estimate the downstream costs. To design the value function approximation, we construct various sets of basis functions, numerically evaluate their suitability, and discuss the properties of good basis functions for the dispatching problem. Numerical experiments on toy-sized instances show that the best set of basis functions approximates the optimal values with an error of less than 3\%. To cope with large action spaces, we formulate an integer linear program to be used within our ADP algorithm. We evaluate the performance of ADP policies against four benchmark policies: two heuristic policies, a direct cost minimization policy, and a post-decision rollout policy. We test the performance of ADP on a variety of networks. ADP consistently outperforms the benchmark policies, performing particularly well when there is sufficient flexibility in dispatch times.

One aspect of neighborhood enumeration in particular has been under the radar of researchers: the order in which neighbors are enumerated.

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization topics, due to its practical importance and methodological interest. Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies are hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution methods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is becoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care for details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the opportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple -- open-source -- implementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm uses the same general methodology as Vidal et al. (2012) but also includes additional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade of research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP* which consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an insertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of SWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches. Moreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches on the classical instances of Uchoa et al. (2017), HGS still stands as a leading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and conceptual simplicity.},

The second one starts from several assignment rules without considering the resource constraint, and repairs the non feasible assignments in order to obtain a feasible solution. Several computation experiments are carried out over an extensive benchmark. A comparative evaluation against previously proposed mathematical models and matheuristics (combination of mathematical models and heuristics) is carried out. From the results, we can conclude that our methods outperform the existing ones, and the second strategy performs better, especially for large instances.},

  abstract = {Scheduling problems are quite difficult to solve since in many cases no exact algorithms exist which can obtain the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, these problems are often solved by using various metaheuristic methods, like genetic algorithms. To use these methods, the first step which needs to be performed is to define an encoding scheme that will be used to represent the solutions. Until now, several encoding schemes were proposed for the unrelated machines environment, each of which comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. However, the performance of metaheuristic methods depends on the applied encoding scheme. Unfortunately, no extensive research was performed in the literature to compare different solution representations for the unrelated machines scheduling problem. Therefore, the choice of the solution representation used is mostly provisional and is usually not based on any existing knowledge of how it would perform on the considered problem. This can cause the algorithms to obtain suboptimal results, which can lead to wrong conclusions about the performance. Thus, the goal of this paper is to test seven solution representations that were used in previous studies to represent solutions for the unrelated machines scheduling problem. The selected solution representations were tested for optimising four scheduling criteria, while additionally measuring the execution time of the genetic algorithm when using each of the encodings. The obtained results demonstrate that the encoding which is based on the permutation of jobs obtains the best results, making it the superior encoding scheme for this type of scheduling problem.},

We introduce a multi-vehicle dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time constraints that incorporates key features associated with same-day delivery logistics. To make better informed decisions, our solution approach incorporates information about future requests into routing decisions. We also introduce an analytical result that identifies when it is beneficial for vehicles to wait at the depot. We present a wide range of computational experiments that demonstrate the value of our approach. The results show that more requests can be filled when time windows are evenly spread throughout the day compared to when many requests' time windows occur late in the day. However, the anticipation of future requests is most valuable when many requests' time windows occur late in the day. As a result of increased flexibility, experiments also demonstrate that the value of anticipating the future decreases when the number of vehicles or the arrival rate of requests increases.

  abstract = {In business-to-consumer (B2C) parcel delivery the presence of the customer at the time of delivery is implicitly required in many cases. If the customer is not at home, the delivery fails -- causing additional costs and effort for the parcel service provider as well as inconvenience for the customer. Parcel service providers typically report high failed-delivery rates, as they have limited possibilities to arrange a delivery time with the recipient. We address the failed-delivery problem in B2C parcel delivery by considering customer-individual availability profiles (APs) that consist of a set of time windows, each associated with a probability that the delivery is successful if conducted in the respective time window. To assess the benefit of APs for delivery tour planning, we formulate the vehicle routing problem with availability profiles (VRPAP) as a mixed integer program (MIP), including the tradeoff between transportation and failed-delivery costs. We provide analytical insights concerning the model's cost savings potential by determining lower and upper bounds. In order to solve larger instances we develop a novel hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (HALNS). The HALNS is highly adaptable and also able to solve related time-constrained vehicle routing problems, i.e., vehicle routing problems with hard, multiple and soft time windows. We show its performance on these related benchmark instances and find a total of 20 new best-known solutions. We additionally conduct various experiments on self-generated VRPAP instances to generate managerial insights. In a case study using real-world data, despite little information on the APs, we were able to reduce failed deliveries by approximately 12\% and overall costs by 5\%.},

The HALNS generates a population of solutions by executing an ALNS several times. Then, the population is subject to a crossover phase, during which new individuals are created by re-applying the ALNS that utilizes information from the population. We streamline the HALNS for the capacitated VRP and the VRP with time windows. The versions implemented use specialized removal operators, a simple insertion operator, an improved crossover mechanism, and unlike the HALNS, no adaptive operator selection, leading to the description as hybrid large neighborhood search (HLNS). In the case of the CVRP, we extend the HLNS by a strong local search based on the open-source implementation of Vidal's hybrid genetic search. The HLNS achieves competitive results on small to medium size benchmark instances, but is less effective for large-scale instances due to the lack of sparsification techniques or neighborhood limitations. Despite this shortcoming, the HLNS is a simple framework that can be easily adapted for further VRP variants.},

To fulfill these orders, retailers must ship multiple parcels from different locations and\textemdash unless they are grouped somewhere along the supply chain\textemdash these may reach the customer's doorstep one by one. Academic/practical relevance: We conjecture here that receiving products sequentially instead of all together affects a consumer's reaction to her purchases, possibly influencing\textemdash for good or ill\textemdash her decision to return products, as well as her overall service satisfaction. We use two-year granular data from an online fashion marketplace to test this hypothesis and characterize consumer behavioral responses to delivery consolidation and examine how it impacts supply chain stakeholders. Methodology: To achieve causal inference, we exploit the fact that the couriers used by the focal marketplace gather together certain parcels for reasons related more to the timing of their arrival than their actual customers, thereby exogenously consolidating the delivery of some orders. We construct a balanced sample of matched twin multiproduct orders that are alike in all respects except their delivery: consolidated (all parcels delivered jointly) versus otherwise (split). Results: We find that delivery consolidation benefits the marketplace and all its suppliers. By eliminating the stress associated with split deliveries, delivery consolidation pleases consumers as it leads to fewer returns and higher overall satisfaction. Managerial implications: Delivering all products in an order together, even if later, reduces the probability of a return, which improves the financial performance of the marketplace and its suppliers and reduces reverse logistics. Our results suggest that in our context, delivery speed matters less than the convenience of receiving all ordered goods in a single delivery, and we provide directions for adapting logistics strategies accordingly. Our empirical findings also imply that the return decisions of multiple products purchased at once should not be considered to be independent. Finding tractable ways of modeling this feature will be necessary in further driving retail practice through theoretical research that accounts for the behavioral implications of delivery consolidation when optimizing fulfillment decisions.

  abstract = {Many transit agencies operating paratransit and microtransit services have to respond to trip requests that arrive in real-time, which entails solving hard combinatorial and sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. To avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term, vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility function or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility function. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be performed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch paratransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the environment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g., traffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline to become stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic trip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse - our problem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP as a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate actions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging; indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice. To tackle the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to design heuristics that can sample promising actions for the tree search. Our experiments using real-world data from our partner agency show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both in terms of performance and robustness.},

Although minimizing boarding time therefore is the most important goal from an economic perspective, previous efforts to design efficient boarding strategies apparently never tackled this task directly. In this paper, we first rigorously define the problem and prove its NP-hardness. Although this generally justifies the development of inexact solution methods, we show that all commonly discussed boarding strategies may in fact give solutions that are far from optimal. We complement these theoretical findings by a simple time-aware boarding strategy with guaranteed approximation quality (under reasonable assumptions) as well as a local improvement heuristic and an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. Our numerical experiments with simulation data show that for several airplane cabin layouts, provably high-quality or even optimal solutions can be obtained within reasonable time in practice by means of our MIP approach. We also empirically assess the sensitivity of boarding strategies with respect to disruptions of the prescribed boarding sequences and identify robustness against such disruptions as a bottleneck for further improvements.},

The general representation and overview of JSSP models are also presented. Then, some extensive statistics and analysis are conducted on 297 published papers in 72 journals ranging between 2016 and early 2021.

  abstract = {The scheduling problems of distributed production have received increasing attention in recent years. To coordinate the scheduling of production and transportation, we propose a novel distributed assembly permutation flowshop scheduling problem with flexible assembly and batch delivery (DAPFSP-FABD). The objective is to minimise the total cost of delivery and tardiness. Given that the problem involves six successive decisions, several batch allocation strategies for both production and distribution are proposed, and four neighbourhood structures are designed to search for the best batch sequence, batch allocation, product sequence, and job sequence. Seven algorithms, including four heuristics, a variable neighbourhood descent (VND) algorithm, and two iterated greedy (IG) algorithms, are proposed. In the IG, two types of destruction and construction operations are present to facilitate escape from local optima, thereby resulting in two IG algorithms: IG\_desP and IG\_desJ. Finally, extensive computational and statistical experiments are carried out. The results show that the proposed batch allocation strategies can improve the solution significantly. Additionally, the heuristics can obtain reasonable solutions in a short time, while IG\_desJ performs the best regarding the quality of solutions. This study can help cross-regional companies coordinate the scheduling of production and transportation and enhance the performance of supply chains.},

Among them, flowshop scheduling problems happen when a number of jobs have to be sequentially processed by a number of machines. This paper addressees, for the first time, the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling problem with additional Resources during Setups (PFSR-S). In this problem, in addition to the standard permutation flowhsop constraints, each machine requires a setup between the processing of two consecutive jobs. A number of additional and scarce resources, e.g. operators, are needed to carry out each setup. Two Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations and an exact algorithm are proposed to solve the PFSR-S. Due to its complexity, these approaches can only solve instances of small size to optimality. Therefore, a GRASP metaheuristic is also proposed which provides solutions for much larger instances. All the methods designed for the PFSR-S in this paper are computationally tested over a benchmark of instances adapted from the literature. The results obtained show that the GRASP metaheuristic finds good quality solutions in short computational times.},

The HGA is compared with one of the most effective heuristics and a recent meta-heuristic on 120 benchmark instances.

  abstract = {The scheduling and location (ScheLoc) problem is a new and important research topic with a wide range of practical applications. It jointly optimizes machine locations, job assignments, and sequence decisions to yield a globally optimal solution. Current studies on the ScheLoc problem are limited, and most have focused on makespan minimization. This paper investigates a new variant of the parallel-machine ScheLoc problem with job delivery time and due date considerations. This is motivated by practical situations where jobs must be transported back to their original locations upon completion of processing, and a specific due date is associated with each job. The objective is to minimize the total weighted sum of location, transportation, and tardiness penalty costs incurred if a job is delivered after its due date. We propose three models adapted from classic ones for scheduling problems. We then develop an exact logic-based Benders decomposition method, which decomposes the problem into a master problem (MP) for determining machine locations and job assignments, and a subproblem (SP) for determining job sequences on each machine. The MP is augmented by dynamically adding optimality cuts generated by solving the SP. We also develop a matheuristic (MH) and its variant to achieve near-optimal solutions. An approximate model with predetermined job processing sequences on each machine is formulated and solved to determine the machine locations and job assignments. The obtained solutions are further improved by solving a series of single-machine scheduling problems. The variant combines a kernel search framework to make MH more efficient. Computational experiments on 720 randomly generated instances show the effectiveness and efficiency of both the exact and matheuristic methods.},

First, we formulate a scenario subset selection model that optimizes the recourse approximation over a pool of solutions. We provide a theoretical justification of our formulation, and a tailored heuristic to solve it. Second, we propose a scenario assortment optimization approach to compute a lower bound\textemdash hence, an optimality gap\textemdash by relaxing nonanticipativity constraints across scenario ``bundles.''

We test our approach on stochastic programs with continuous and mixed-integer recourse. Results show that (i) our scenario reduction method dominates scenario reduction benchmarks, (ii) our scenario assortment optimization, combined with column-evaluation-and-generation, yields tight lower bounds, and (iii) our overall approach results in stronger solutions, tighter lower bounds, and faster computational times than state-of-the-art stochastic programming algorithms.
